How to compile Daikon from source.

This README is intended for developers working with source cloned from
Daikon's version control repository.

1.  Choose the directory where you want to install Daikon; we'll call
this the daikonparent directory.  In this directory, make a clone of
Daikon's version control repository, named "daikon":

git clone https://github.com/codespecs/daikon.git

2.  Set your environment variables according to the instructions in 
list item 2, of section 2.2.2 of the Daikon manual:
http://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/download/doc/daikon.html#Unix_002fLinux_002fMacOSX-installation

3.  Compile Daikon:

cd $DAIKONDIR
make compile

4.  Build the documentation.

make doc-all

At this point you have local copies of the documentation, which
may be more up-to-date than those on Daikon's webpage.

If you plan to use Kvasir, the C/C++ front end for Daikon, then follow
these additional steps:

5.  Make a clone of Fjalar's version control repository, named "fjalar",
as a sibling of the daikon clone.

cd $DAIKONDIR
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/codespecs/fjalar.git

6.  Build Fjalar (which includes Kvasir).  The following commands build
the Fjalar/Kvasir shared library, install it locally, and make a symbolic
link to it in your Daikon tree.

cd $DAIKONDIR
make kvasir
