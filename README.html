<h1>Daikon invariant detector distribution</h1>

<p>
This is the distribution of the
<a href="http://pag.csail.mit.edu/daikon/">Daikon invariant detector</a>,
Daikon version 4.6.4, released June 23, 2010.
</p>

<p>
If you are working with a Daikon distribution downloaded from the Daikon
website, then most everything is setup and ready to go.
You should start out by reading the
<a href="doc/index.html">documentation</a> which includes
installation instructions.<br />
<br />
However, if you are working with source cloned from the Google Code
repository Daikon, then please review the file README.source.
