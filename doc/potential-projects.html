<h2 id="exceptional-invariants">Infer invariants over exceptional executions</h2>

<p>
The <a href="https://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/">Daikon invariant
detector</a> is a machine-learning tool that infers specifications for
programs.  It automatically reports facts about your program, such as
</p>
<ul>
  <li>"x.field &gt; abs(y)";
  </li>
  <li>"y = 2*x+3";
  </li>
  <li>"array a is sorted";
  </li>
  <li>"for all list objects lst, lst.next.prev = lst";
  </li>
  <li>"for all treenode objects n, n.left.value &lt; n.right.value";
  </li>
  <li>"p &ne; null &rArr; p.content in myArray";
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
However, it ignores any procedure call that throws an exception.  Thus, it cannot report useful information about exceptional executions, such as what causes a program to throws an exception or what properties are true after the exception is thrown.
</p>

<p>
This project would extend Daikon to handle exceptional execution.
</p>

<p>
The project has these components:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>defining the feature.  What is the relationship between normal and exceptional executions?  Should summary information about *all* executions ever be output, or should they be kept strictly separate?  What about information about different types of exceptions?  Defining the feature is an interesting challenge.  At least three designs have been proposed, but each has limitations.
  </li>
  <li>Adjust Daikon's implementation.  This may be as easy as defining new &ldquo;exception exit points&rdquo; and adding them to Daikon's existing program point hierarchy.
  </li>
  <li>Change front ends that create Daikon input files, so that they output information about exceptions.
  </li>
  <li>Evaluate the results.
  </li>
</ul>


<h2 id="array-nonsensical">Finer-grained handling of arrays</h2>

<p>
  Sometimes, an expression's value is "missing".  For example, if <code>x</code> is <code>null</code>, then there is no value for the expression <code>x.field</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Daikon does not currently allow nonsensical elements to appear in arrays.
  Change it so that it does.  (This probably requires an overhaul of
  Daikon's data structures and algorithms.
</p>



<h2 id="observer-arguments">Pure (observer) methods that take parameters</h2>

<p>
  Daikon can report properties in terms of methods defined in a class.  For example, it can report that <code>arg.isEmpty()</code>  is always true on entry to a method.
</p>

<p>
  However, Daikon cannot currently handle pure (observer) methods that take parameters.
    For example, the HashMap.add() invariants should include:
<pre>
  pre: !containsKey(key)
  post: containsKey(key)
</pre>
<!--
The chicory code is in directory: invariants/java/daikon/chicory/

The following files contain either "pure" or "purity":
  ChicoryPremain.java
  ClassInfo.java
  DaikonClassInfo.java
  DaikonVariableInfo.java
  MethodInfo.java
  PureMethodInfo.java
  Runtime.java

Questions:
 * Is Daikon's purity file support working properly now?  Add some tests to
   the test suite.
 * Does JPPA output pure methods that take arguments?  (Probably.)  What
   does Daikon do with these now?  Ignore?  Warn?
 * For a pure method that takes arguments, which parameters should be
   passed in?  Probably every variable at the program point that has the
   right type.  What is the best way to determine these?  Probably, look
   them up in Chicory's other data structures.)  Should they be represented
   as an alias into Chicory's other data structures, or copied (redundantly
   represented)?
 * If this is implemented entirely in the front end (Chicory), as it
   probably should be, then derived variables will never be used in calls
   to pure methods.  That's OK, but should be documented.
-->


<h2 id="ignore-unused-variables">Ignore unused variables</h2>

<p>
    Ignore unused variables.  Currently Daikon outputs data about
    <em>all</em> variables, but it would speed Daikon up to perform output
    only for variables that a given procedure may read or write.  As a significant side
    benefit, this could also eliminate some irrelevant output.
</p>

<!--

Suppose you have a method

  class MyClass {
    int field1;
    int field2;
    int field3;
    ...
    int field99;
    int field100;

    int myMethod() {
      return field1 + field2;
    }
  }

Every time that myMethod executes, the front end will output the values of
all 100 fields.  But only 2 of the fields are relevant.  This leads to two
problems:
 * Speed:  the front end takes time to output all the variables, and Daikon
   takes time to process all those variables (10,000 pairs of variables to
   compare instead of 1 pair).
 * Irrelevant output:  The user may not care that field3 > field4 whenever
   myMethod is invoked.  Outputting that property distracts the user from
   important properties about field1 and field2.  Furthermore, since Daikon
   is considering 10,000 pairs of variables, some properties may be true
   purely by accident that are not useful.

This project would proceed in the following stages:
 1. Write a static analysis (of source code or of binaries such as
    bytecode) that determines, for a method m, all the variables that may be
    read or written by m or by any method that m may call.  These are the
    relevant variables.
 2. Change Daikon's front ends to only output the relevant variables.  An
    easy way to do this is to not change the program point declarations or
    which variables appear in samples, but to use the value "nonsensical" (see
    http://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/download/doc/daikon.html#Data-trace-records )
    for all non-relevant variables.  This will lead to performance
    improvements as Daikon will ignore any variable that is always
    nonsensical.
 3. A better way is to change the program point declaration to not even
    include the non-relevant variables.  This can lead to smaller file
    sizes and possibly to larger performance improvements.

<h1 id="performance">Performance</h1>


<h2 id="type-abstraction">Evaluate performance and usability costs of abstraction over types</h2>

<p>
A programmer often needs to write code that is polymorphic:  it operates
over multiple datatypes.  For instance, a graph algorithm might need to
work whether the data in the graph is integers or floating-point values.
</p>

<p>
Programming languages provide abstraction mechanisms for creating
polymorphic code, such as C++'s templates and Java's generics.  These
mechanisms have the benefit of reducing code duplication.  They also have
costs, such as increasing indirection (making the code harder to
understand) and reducing performance (due to creation of wrapper objects).
</p>

<p>
As a result, programmers still frequently perform manual specialization:
they maintain multiple copies of code.  Oracle recognizes these tradeoffs.
They wish
to <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/jvmls2016-goetz-3126134.pdf">&ldquo;Stop
making users choose between performance and abstraction&rdquo;</a>.
Likewise, the
book <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596527754.do"><em>Java
Generics and Collections</em></a> says, &ldquo;you should measure
performance to justify such a design&rdquo; (of specializing or not).  In a
2007 experiment, specializing Quicksort improved performance by 25%
(https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1297909).  However, the JIT compiler
has improved in the meanwhile, and there have been few recent studies of
the performance impacts.
</p>

<p>
The goal of this project is to evaluate the costs and benefits of multiple ways of writing code, such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>maintaining multiple copies of the code that are specialized to
  different datatypes
  </li>
  <li>using Java abstractions (classes, generics) to avoid code duplication
  </li>
  <li>using a preprocessor to generate Java code, which avoids duplication
  and achieves good performance but complicates the build system and makes
  it harder to use an IDE
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
A good case study for this is
the <a href="https://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/">Daikon invariant
detector</a>, a machine-learning tool that infers specifications for
programs.  It is actively maintained and the maintainers are interested in
improving it.  It currently uses a preprocessor, which makes it easy for
you to compare all the different approaches.
</p>


<h2 id="parallelize">Parallelize Daikon</h2>

<p>
Daikon runs in a single thread.  However, its algorithms process each
program point (such as a method entry or exit) in isolation.  Because most
computers have multiple CPUs, Daikon could be made to run faster by using
multiple threads, each of which processes just some program points.
</p>

<p>
This is an interesting exercise for someone who is interested in
concurrency and parallelism.
</p>



<h2 id="compact-file-format">Compact trace file format</h2>

Daikon's input and output are large ASCII files.
Writing and parsing these files can take 50% of the total
    run time of the system!  A binary format would be much smaller on
    disk.  It would speed up IO.  It would reduce computation time by
    reducing the time to format and parse data.

-->



<h2 id="unchanged-variables">Avoid recomputation over unchanged variables</h2>

    Don't do computation over final statics and enums.  These constants
    never change, so comparisons over them are wasted effort.

It might be both more efficient and provide better
    output to examine the one-ofs and other sample dependent invariants
    at the end of the run and substitute in constants where they
    match.

<!--  It probably doesn't
    make sense to include these as separate variables, since they are
    constants.  It might be both more efficient and provide better
    output to examine the one-ofs and other sample-dependent invariants
    at the end of the run and substitute in constants where they
    match.
-->


<h1 id="program-structure">Improved program structure and abstractions</h1>


<h2 id="array-invariants">Array invariants</h2>



  <p>
    Daikon can compute properties both over individual variables, and over
    all the elements of an array (via so-called "elt invariants").  Each
    elt invariant is individually written, which is error-prone.  Find a
    way to enable this code to be defined just once, without degrading
    Daikon's structure nor its performance.  For example, elt invariants
    could be computed from the implementation for each normal (non-array)
    invariant.
  </p>


<h2 id="libraries">Libraries</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Change Daikon's command-line processing to use
    <a href="http://plumelib.org/options/api/org/plumelib/options/Options.html">plume.Options</a>
    instead.
<!--
Documentation of command-line options in the manual should be
automatically-generated from the @Option fields.  First, move the useful
text from the manual to documentation...
-->
  </li>
  <li>
    Replace Daikon's use of the <a href="http://compilers.cs.ucla.edu/jtb/">JTB</a> library by
    <a href="http://javaparser.org/">http://javaparser.org/</a>.
