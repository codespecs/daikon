Documentation:
- Improved discussion of DynComp and comparability sets.

===========================================================================

5.4.6 (January 3, 2017)

The changes in this release reflect an increased emphasis on using the
DynComp tool for both Java and C/C++.

Daikon:
- Several improvements to the DynComp for Java tool, including:
  - support for multi-threaded programs
  - improved support for user programs that throw exceptions
  - recover gracefully from methods too large to instrument

Documentation:
- Simplified and improved the Installation chapter of the User Guide.
- Modified the Example usage chapter of the User Guide to more accurately
  describe the tool options and expected outputs.

===========================================================================

5.4.4 (December 2, 2016)

- Fixed calculation of a class's fields to include fields of its superclass(es).
- Corrected files included in daikon.tar to support building the documents.
- Corrected behavior of the calc_possible_invs configuration option.

===========================================================================

5.4.2 (November 3, 2016)

Fixed numerous DynComp bugs.

===========================================================================

5.4.0 (October 4, 2016)

daikon.jar now includes Apache Commons BCEL 6.0; previously it used a
locally-modified version of BCEL.  We have removed the "--default-bcel"
command-line option; Daikon will fail if some other version of BCEL is
found on the classpath.

===========================================================================

5.3.10 (September 1, 2016)

A new front end for LLVM is available.
See https://github.com/markus-kusano/udon.
You can use it with any program that can be compiled to LLVM.

Chicory command-line argument --instrument-clinit causes Chicory to output
empty dtrace records when static initializers are entered and exited.  This
is useful for clients that use Chicory to trace method entry and exit.

Daikon does stricter checking of its input files.  Older versions of Kvasir
and Chicory create invalid .decls or .dtrace files, which Daikon now
rejects.  If this happens, re-run the front end to create new, correct files.

Updated the Binutils-based code in Fjalar/Kvasir to v2.26.1.
There should be no user-visible differences in the behavior of Kvasir.

Several options to the Kvasir DynComp feature (--with-dyncomp) were renamed
to be more consistent:
  --gc-num-tags                => --dyncomp-gc-num-tags
  --no-dyncomp-gc              => --dyncomp-gc-num-tags=0
  --dyncomp-fast-mode          => --dyncomp-approximate-literals
  --separate-entry-exit-comp   => --dyncomp-separate-entry-exit
  --dyncomp-dataflow-only      => --dyncomp-interactions=none
  --dyncomp-dataflow-comp      => --dyncomp-interactions=comparisons
  --dyncomp-units              => --dyncomp-interactions=units
  [new option; is the default] => --dyncomp-interactions=all

===========================================================================

5.3.8 (August 1, 2016)

Improved portability:
 * support g++ 6.1
 * support Fedora 23
 * support newer version of jdk8

Miscellaneous bug fixes and minor improvements.

===========================================================================

5.3.6 (July 5, 2016)

A new front end for Simulink/Stateflow (SLSF) block diagrams is available.
See https://bitbucket.org/verivital/hynger .

Fjalar/Kvasir:
 - DynComp has been modified to improve its accuracy and correct its
   garbage collection routine.

===========================================================================

5.3.4 (June 1, 2016)

Miscellaneous bug fixes and minor improvements.

===========================================================================

5.3.2 (May 2, 2016)

Daikon:
 - Command-line argument --user-defined-invariant makes Daikon compute a
   user-defined invariant in addition to those that are built in to Daikon.
 - Command-line argument --disable-all-invariants disables all of Daikon's
   built-in invariants.  Subsequent command-line options may enable some of
   them.

Fjalar/Kvasir:
 - Minor changes to support Scientific Linux.

Documentation:
- Improved the discussion in the Troubleshooting chapter of the User Guide
  on how to respond to "Could not find or load main class."

===========================================================================

5.3.0 (April 5, 2016)

Daikon:
- We have improved splitter processing. Splitter expressions containing
  'orig' now work correctly.  Also, A splitter expression containing
  references to a parameter and an unqualified member variable with the
  name will now work correctly.

Kvasir:
- We updated the underlying Valgrind infrastructure to version 3.11.0.
  Users of Kvasir to analyze C/C++ codes should not see any differences
  in behavior from the previous version.

Documentation:
- Improved discussion of program points.

We have decided to deprecate support for 32-bit hosts.
- Fjalar/Kvasir, the C/C++ front end for Daikon, no longer builds on a 32-bit
  platform and we will no longer support the 32-bit version of this tool.
- At the present time, Chicory and Daikon continue to build and run on a
  32-bit platform, but we have stopped testing this configuration and make
  no guarantees for the future.

===========================================================================

5.2.26 (March 10, 2016)

This is an update to 5.2.24 to correct a small problem in Chicory.  It was
inadvertently adding extra information to its output files.  This did not
cause Daikon to operate incorrectly.  It only made the data files larger
than necessary.

===========================================================================

5.2.24 (March 4, 2016)

Documentation:
- Added more examples of invariants.
- Improved instructions on building Daikon and Kvasir.

===========================================================================

5.2.22 (February 1, 2016)

We have updated the Daikon tool set to include a newer version of BCEL.
If Chicory throws an error such as the following:
    "BCEL must be in the classpath.  Normally it is found in daikon.jar."
Then the problem is most likely that your classpath contains a previous
version of daikon.jar or plume.jar.

===========================================================================

5.2.20 (January 5, 2016)

Documentation:
- Improved instructions on building Daikon and Kvasir.

===========================================================================

5.2.18 (December 5, 2015)

Daikon:
- Avoid ConcurrentModificationException in the FileIOProgress thread.
- Makefile in distribution is now the same as in a cloned repository.

Kvasir:
- Eliminated OS-specific regression test failures.

Documentation:
- New manual section "Detecting invariants when running a Java program from
  a jar file"
- Restructured developer manual section "Requirements for compiling Daikon"

Distribution:
- The distribution contains new directories doc/www, java/jtb, and java/lib,
  which makes the directory layout more like the repository's.

===========================================================================

5.2.16 (November 2, 2015)

Chicory:
- Improved handling of Java code containing synchronized locks.
- Improved handling of Java initialization methods containing calls
  to other initialization methods.

Daikon:
- The --shiny-print option was renamed --abridged-vars to match the
  documentation.

Kvasir:
- We made some changes to the DynComp tool to improve the accuracy of the
  comparability information. Occasionally, the system loader was causing
  unrelated items to be placed in the same comparability set.

===========================================================================

5.2.14 (October 5, 2015)

Daikon:
  We have improved splitter verification testing.

Documentation:
  Improved discussion of splitters

===========================================================================

5.2.12 (September 3, 2015)

Daikon:
  We have improved splitter file processing.

Documentation:
  Improved discussion of splitters

===========================================================================

5.2.10 (August 4, 2015)

Chicory:
- Modified generation of comparability values when using input from DynComp
  .decls file via --comparability-file option.  When the resulting .dtrace
  file is fed to Daikon, the number of uninteresting invariants is reduced.

DynComp:
- Correctly identify methods that are in the Java SE Development Kit (JDK).
- Fix problems with non-local field access.
- Fix problems with use of some javax classes.

LogicalCompare:
- The "debug-all" option has been changed to "debug" to be consistent with
  the other Daikon tools.

Changes relevant to building from source:
- Now support gcc 5.1.1 and Fedora 22.

===========================================================================

5.2.8 (July 1, 2015)

The Daikon and Fjalar version control repositories have moved from Google
Code to GitHub, and from the Mercurial version control system to Git.  You
should not use any old clone of the Mercurial repositories.  You can obtain
the new version control repositories by running:

  git clone https://github.com/codespecs/daikon.git
  git clone https://github.com/codespecs/fjalar.git

The location of the Celeriac front end has changed:
  https://github.com/codespecs/daikon-dot-net-front-end

The Daikon .tar and .zip release file names now include the version number;
e.g., daikon-5.2.8.zip instead of daikon.zip.  The same renaming is true
of the top-level directory within these archive files.

Documentation:
- The developer manual has an improved discussion of comparability values.
- Developer manual section A.5, "Example files", has been updated.
- The user manual has an improved discussion of mixed .decls and .dtrace
  files.  This includes some clarification of how to use the output(s) of
  Chicory and DynComp with Daikon.
- Improved formatting of Javadoc.

===========================================================================

5.2.6 (June 2, 2015)

Daikon:
  Changed default value of --suppressSplitterErrors command-line option to true.

Chicory:
  Improved support for nested classes.  When processing an object of inner
  class type, Chicory outputs outer class fields just like inner class fields.

DynComp:
  Fixed a problem with DynComp not working properly with JDK 8.

Changes relevant to building from source:
  The plume-lib library's version control repository has moved.
  If you are currently building Daikon from a clone of our repository, run:
     cd $DAIKONDIR
     hg pull -u
     rm -rf $DAIKONDIR/plume-lib
     make -C $DAIKONDIR compile

===========================================================================

5.2.4 (May 1, 2015)

Tools that process invariant files:
  Fixed a problem with Annotate and improved its output

The parser used by several tools (Annotate and RuntimeChecker, for example)
has been improved to understand the 'diamond operator' ("<>") used for
type inference in generic instance creation.

Documentation:
  Improved discussion of splitters

The location of the Celeriac front end has changed:
  https://github.com/melonhead901/daikon-dot-net-front-end


===========================================================================

5.2.2 (April 10, 2015)

Tools that process invariant files:

  Renamed LogicalCompare program's --cfg command-line argument to
  --config_option, for consistency with other programs in the Daikon suite.

  Improved the documentation for the Daikon runtimechecker tool.

Kvasir C/C++ front end:

  Fixed a problem with creating pointer type disambiguation files when
  using the --disambig and --disambig-file options to Kvasir.

  Updated the Binutils-based code in Fjalar/Kvasir from v2.24 to v2.25.
  There should be no user-visible differences in the behavior of Kvasir.

  Removed documentation for the galar front-end tool as it is no longer
  supported.

Bug fixes:

  Fixed an intermittently occurring problem in Chicory with instrumenting
  Java methods containing a switch.

  Fixed several Daikon issues:
  #18: runtimechecker should not instrument abstract classes
  #19: runtimechecker parser problem with ">" characters
  #20: runtimechecker problem with 'Is power of 2'
  #22: runtimechecker fails on inner classes with multiple constructors
  #23: runtimechecker crashes when foreach variable has a final modifier

===========================================================================

5.2.0 (March 3, 2015)

  We updated the underlying Valgrind infrastructure to version 3.10.1
  (build 14784).  Users of Kvasir to analyze C/C++ codes should not see
  any differences in behavior from the previous version.

  We made various improvements to the documentation.

===========================================================================

5.1.16 (February 2, 2015)

  Splitters now properly support unqualified member variables within
  .spinfo files.

  Fjalar support improved for C++ static const items.  (For more information,
  see Daikon issue #37: https://github.com/codespecs/daikon/issues/37.)

  Updated bcel.jar (within plume.jar) for some minor improvements in
  JDK 8 support.

===========================================================================

5.1.14 (December 22, 2014)

  Fjalar now builds correctly on Ubuntu 14.10.
  Improved installation instructions.
  Improved documentation on Simplify tool.
  Chicory and DynComp now support Java/JDK 8. (tested with 1.8.0-b129)

===========================================================================

5.1.12 (December 2, 2014)

  Celeriac, Daikon's front end for .NET programs, works under Mono.
  See https://github.com/codespecs/daikon-dot-net-front-end .

  The declaration file format supports five new variable-info fields:
    min-value
    max-value
    min-length
    max-length
    valid-values
  These specify what possible values may appear in the trace file, and they
  enable Daikon to suppress invariants that are obvious due to, for example,
  programming language limitations on the values for a particular type.
  Thanks to Antonio Garcia Dominguez for contributing this feature.

  The Daikon installation tests now pass when the current locale is not en_US.

  We have fixed bugs in Daikon splitter file processing.  For example, a
  splitter condition can now reference a local variable and a global
  variable with the same name.  (The global variable, of course, requires a
  class name prefix.)

  If you work from a clone of the repository, as opposed to downloading the
  Daikon release, then there needs to be a symbolic link named 'fjalar'
  from the Daikon clone to the Fjalar clone.  After this change, you need to
  regenerate the fjalar Makefiles.
  To accomplish all of this, run the following commands:
    cd $DAIKONDIR
    rm -f kvasir   # remove old link
    ln -s ../fjalar fjalar
    cd $DAIKONDIR/fjalar/valgrind
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --prefix=`pwd`/inst

===========================================================================

5.1.10 (October 31, 2014)

  We have fixed some problems in Kvasir with C++ code.  We now correctly
  support unnamed parameters and subclasses that add no additional data
  members.

  We have modified the output of txt-cset and txt-trace so that the
  invariants detected match those of the decls-DynComp output.

  We have improved Daikon splitter file processing. In particular, the
  handling of arrays has been improved.

  Daikon will now build on Macs with a non-gcc C++ preprocessor.

  We have added a section to the documentation on how to write your
  own tool to manipulate a .dtrace file.

  The manual contains a link to Takuan, a Daikon front end for WS-BPEL
  tool process definitions.

===========================================================================

5.1.8 (September 30, 2014)

  A large number of small corrections were made to the Javadoc annotations
  in the Daikon source tree.  This will most often manifest in the HTML
  documentation as supplying information that was previously missing.

  We have fixed a problem in Kvasir with C++ static members.  This should
  provide more accurate invariants in these cases.

  We have fixed a problem in DynComp with lambda expressions in Java 8
  programs.  Previously, this syntax would cause a program fault.

===========================================================================

5.1.6 (August 29, 2014)

  A section has been added to the Daikon User Manual describing how to
  deal with a "duplicate class definition error" when running Chicory.

  We have fixed a problem (Daikon issue #33) that would cause Chicory to
  crash on input of the form:
    private static final Boolean name = false;

===========================================================================

5.1.4 (July 31, 2014)

  Improved StackMap support.
  - for <init> methods
  - for BASTORE instruction
  Improved Kvasir (C/C++ Daikon front end) support for 32bit hosts.

===========================================================================

5.1.2 (June 30, 2014)

  Improved StackMap support.
  - Both Daikon and DynComp can now process a wider variety of Java 7
    generated StackMaps.
  Documentation updates and cleanup.
  - Added material on CSharpContracts; usage and copyright.

===========================================================================

5.1.0 (May 30, 2014)

  Daikon can now infer code contracts for .NET programs, such as C# programs.
  You will require the Celeriac front end:
    https://github.com/codespecs/daikon-dot-net-front-end
  In the past, when using Celeriac, you were required to use a special version
  of Daikon; now you should just use the regular version of Daikon.

  DynComp for Java now works with Java 7.  Chicory already worked with Java 7,
  but the DynComp component did not work with Java 7 until this release.
  (This is the fix for Daikon issue #24.)

===========================================================================

5.0.8 (May 2, 2014)

General:
  We have modified the directory layout relationship between Daikon
  and Fjalar/Kvasir.  If you acquire Daikon and Fjalar via their Mercurial
  repositories, you need to perform the following steps to adjust a symbolic
  link.  (If you download daikon.zip or daikon.tar.gz from the Daikon
  distribution site, you are not affected.)  For repository users, perform
  the following steps:
    cd $DAIKONDIR
    make -C kvasir uninstall distclean
    rm kvasir
    <hg fetch of the latest daikon and fjalar files>
    cd $DAIKONDIR
    ln -nsf ../fjalar kvasir  // replace "fjalar" with your repository name, if different
    make kvasir

Daikon:
  This release contains fixes for Daikon issues #10, 29 and 30.  See:
  https://github.com/codespecs/daikon/issues/10
  https://github.com/codespecs/daikon/issues/29
  https://github.com/codespecs/daikon/issues/30

Fjalar:
  No significant content changes were made.

Documentation:
  No significant content changes were made.

===========================================================================

5.0.6 (March 28, 2014)

Daikon:
  This release contains a fix for Daikon issue #28.  See:
  https://github.com/codespecs/daikon/issues/28

Fjalar:
  We updated our object code reader to match version 2.24 of the GNU binutils.
  Updated the source copyrights.
  Added two more regressions tests.
  Fixed Daikon issue #28.

  Users of Kvasir to analyze C/C++ codes should not see
  any differences in behavior from the previous version.

Documentation:
  Lots of changes to correct spelling and .texinfo tag usage.
  No significant content changes were made.

===========================================================================

5.0.4 (February 28, 2014)

Daikon:
  This release contains a fix for Daikon issue #27.  See:
  https://github.com/codespecs/daikon/issues/27

Fjalar:
  We updated the underlying Valgrind infrastructure to version 3.9.0
  (build 13710).  In addition, we cleaned up our sources so that there
  are no compiler warnings when building Valgrind/Fjalar/Kvasir.
  As Fjalar is based on the Valgrind tool "memcheck", we have seen one
  new memory usage error when running our tests.  Other than this slim
  possibility, users of Kvasir to analyze C/C++ codes should not see
  any differences in behavior from the previous version.

Documentation:
  We no longer distribute PostScript formatted versions of the documentation.

===========================================================================

5.0.2 (January 31, 2014)

General

  Improved documentation and installation script for Cygwin.
  Added corrected version of inv-cvs to new drop site.
  Several documentation improvements.

Documentation
  Fixed broken links between the two daikon documents.
  Updated some URLS to change MIT => UW.
  Clarified that you must use Java version 7.
  Removed documentation on Csh in favor of Bash.
  Improved pdf output - now includes bookmarks and hyper-links.
  Added split html document versions to drop.
  Improved General Index(s).

===========================================================================

Kvasir front end for C/C++

  User visible changes

    Support for more recent versions of Linux (tested with Fedora 19).
    Support for more recent versions of GNU tools (tested with gcc 4.8.2
    and glibc 2.17).


Mangel-Wurzel front end for C/C++

  It has not been supported for almost a decade, so we have removed all
  references to the Mangel-Wurzel front end from the documentation.


Documentation

  We have enhanced the documentation on using Daikon with Eclipse.

  We no longer distribute Texinfo-formatted "info" versions of the
  documentation.  However, the targets remain in the Makefile if you wish
  to make your own.

  We have added a section to the developer documentation on how to make
  a distribution.

===========================================================================

4.7.5 (December 12, 2013)

An interim release to get an updated version into the field:
  Fix for stack map problem in Chicory.
  The bin directory is now called scripts to be consistent with the Google
  Code repository and the documentation.

===========================================================================

4.7.3 (November 1, 2013)

An interim release to get an updated version into the field:
  Fix for stack map problem in Chicory.

===========================================================================

4.7.1 (October 8, 2013)

An interim release to get updated system support into the field:
  Support for more recent versions of Linux (tested with Fedora 17).
  Support for more recent versions of gnu tools (tested with gcc 4.7.2
    and glibc 2.17).
  Support for Java 7.
  Updated readelf support to version 2.23.2.
  Updated underlying Valgrind from revision 11017 to 12996 and VEX from
    revision 1953 to 2538.  Together, this represents Valgrind 3.8.1.
  Many improvements and bug fixes to Chicory, the Java front end for Daikon.

===========================================================================

4.6.4 (June 23 2010)

Daikon

  User-visible changes

    Added new invariants: CompleteOneOfScalar, CompleteOneOfString

    Added configuration variable daikon.FileIO.rm_stack_dups.

    When calculating the confidence value for an invariant, Daikon
    sometimes estimates the number of possible unique values that have
    been seen.  This calculation has been changed to better handle
    variable that are often missing.  In particular, invariants over
    combinations of variables that are never present in the same
    sample, will have a zero confidence and will thus not normally be
    printed.

    Improved documentation about: handling large data trace files or
    slow Daikon runs; the confidence of each invariant; and the types
    of program point declarations and their relationship to the
    program point hierarchy.

    Daikon uses the JAVA_HOME environment variable, rather than JDKDIR.

  Non-user-visible changes

    Extracted utilMDE and other utilities into a new library named
    plume-lib, which makes it easier to use in other programs.  See
    https://mernst.github.io/plume-lib/.

    Daikon now type-checks with the Nullness Checker (which is part of
    the Checker Framework), with just a few suppressed warnings.  As
    far as we know Daikon is the largest program ever to be verified
    in this way.

    Interned some string variables when de-serializing an invariant file,
    saving an appreciable amount of memory.

Chicory

    Documented Chicory options --boot-classes=REGEX, --linked-lists.

Kvasir

  User-visible changes

    Fixed an issue where Fjalar would not correctly traverse variables
    when using the var-list-file option.

    The var-list-file can specify different global variables for different
    functions, rather than having to specify the same set of global
    variables for all of a program.

    Kvasir's support for GCC 4.4 has been further improved.

  User Documentation

    Added documentation for several previously undocumented Kvasir
    command line options.

DynComp

    Fixed a bug when searching for dcomp_premain.jar.  The jar file will
    now be found if it is anywhere in the classpath.

InvariantChecker

    Added --verbose option that will print all samples that violate an
    invariant.

-------------------------------------------

4.6.3 (December 18 2009)

Kvasir's support for GCC 4.4 has been improved.

Kvasir

  User-visible changes

     The output of variables declared as constant can now be
     suppressed via the "--ignore-constants" flag.

  Bug fixes

     Fixed an issue where Fjalar would not print variables
     declared constant for binaries created with some versions
     of g++.

     Fixed comparability errors which occurred when Kvasir was run
     with dyncomp on an x86-64 host.

-------------------------------------------

4.6.2 (October 1 2009)

Kvasir's support for x86-64 hosts and C++ programs has been improved.

Kvasir

  User visible changes

    Kvasir now has limited support for non-local exits such as
    setjmp/longjmp and C++ Exceptions. Kvasir will correctly detect
    if a function has been exited by non-local means and not print
    an exit program point for the function but continue printing
    other functions as normal. Previously Kvasir would stop printing
    program points after the first non-locally exited function.

    Added support for multi-threaded C/C++ programs.

    Kvasir's now fully supports x86-64 hosts and running x86-64
    binaries.

    Improved Kvasir's speed when working with large C++ binaries.

  Bug fixes

    Fixed an issue where Kvasir would print incorrect values
    for floating point numbers.

    Fixed an issue where Kvasir would print incorrect values
    for parameters to C++ constructors.

    Fixed a memory leak in Fjalar's processing of variable names.

    Fixed a crash that would sometimes occur when processing
    C++ programs with large amounts of debugging information.

Daikon

  User Documentation

    Added an explanation of how additional data changes invariant
    output.

-------------------------------------------

4.6.1 (September 1 2009)

Support for GCC 4.3+ created binaries has been improved for Kvasir.

Daikon

  Documentation

    Appendix A (File Formats) of the Daikon user manual was moved to
    the developers manual.

Kvasir

  User visible changes

    Kvasir should now print more sensible traces for binaries created
    with GCC 4.3.x and 4.4.x.

  Bug fixes

    Fixed an issue where Kvasir would not detect entry to a function if
    it's body consisted of only a loop.

-------------------------------------------

4.6.0 (July 1 2009)

Kvasir now supports binaries created with GCC 4.0+ and glibc versions 2.2
to 2.10.  The Daikon user manual was updated for clarity and completeness.
Bugs were fixed in Daikon, Kvasir, and Chicory.

Daikon

  Documentation

    The installation section of the user manual was rewritten .

    A more complete explanation of nonsensical values was added to
    Appendix A (File formats).

  Bug Fixes

    The declaration version (decl-version) specification only needs to
    be specified once if multiple input files are used.  If it is specified
    in each file, each specification must be the same.

    The Quant code (used when adding invariant checks to the original
    source) did not support character comparisons.  This problem has been
    resolved.

Chicory

  Bug Fixes

    In some circumstances Chicory would not handle the children of static
    variables that were referenced through multiple variables (such
    as a parameter and an instance variable).  This problem has been
    resolved.

    Sampling now works correctly with applications with multiple threads

Kvasir

   User visible changes

	Starting with this release, Kvasir is more closely tracking
	the upstream development of Valgrind, with the aim of getting
	Valgrind portability fixes into our releases in a more timely
	manner. In particular, this release includes the fixes from
	Valgrind's 3.4.1 stable release including initial support for
	glibc version 2.10.

	Kvasir is now able to correctly output dtrace files for binaries
	produced with GCC 4.0+.

	Variables declared with the "register" attribute should now be
	handled correctly.

   Bug fixes

	Fixed an issue where the decls header wasn't printed if Kvasir was
	run with DynComp.

	Fixed an issue where extra decls headers were printed when Kvasir
	was in append mode.

	Fixed an issue where Kvasir attempted to print variables for which
	there was no debugging information available.

-------------------------------------------

4.5.5 (April 1 2009)

Support for Daikon and DynComp for Java has been improved for MacOSX.
The Daikon user and developer manuals were enhanced.

Daikon

    Documentation

        A section was added describing approaches for writing automated
        tools that process Daikon output

        A new section (5.4.3) was added explaining the "Has only one value"
        invariant.

        Detail was added to the section (6.5) on Loop invariants

        Information on compiling Daikon for MacOSX was added to
        section 2.1 of the Daikon Developers manual.

DynComp Java

    Documentation

        Information describing how to create an instrumented JDK on MacOSX
        was added to Section 7.2.1 (Instrumenting the JDK with DynComp)

-------------------------------------------

4.5.4 (February 2 2009)

Bugs were fixed in Chicory and AnnotateNullable.  Daikon's
documentation was improved.

Chicory

    Bug fixes

        A problem the occurred when a purity file is specified
        was resolved.

        In some circumstances, when classes are dynamically created at
        runtime, Chicory would incorrectly determine that the class
        was a user class (i.e., not part of the JDK).  This would
        result in classloader areas.  This has been resolved

Daikon

    Documentation

        The Daikon user manual was improved with more detailed information
        on compiling Daikon, creating implications, and the information
        required with bug reports.

AnnotateNullable

    Bug fixes

        A null pointer exception that occurred in the case of the
        default package was fixed.


-------------------------------------------

4.5.3 (January 2 2009)

Resolved a number of problems in the build scripts and documentation for a
complete Windows installation.

Daikon

  Bug fixes

    Some build problems on Windows were fixed.  Checks were added to
    ensure that the correct version of find is found and the OSTYPE
    is set correctly.

  Documentation

    The complete installation for Windows now requires Cygwin.  The
    instructions were largely rewritten to make the required setup
    clear (particularly the format of filenames and paths).

----------------------------------------

4.5.2 (December 1 2008)

Some new String invariants were added to Daikon.

Daikon

  User visible changes

    Added elementwise String comparison (equal, lessthan, greaterthan,
    lessthanequal, greaterthan equal) invariants (enabled by default).

    Added a SubString invariant and an elementwise SubString invariant
    (disabled by default)

----------------------------------------

4.5.1 (November 3 2008)

A new front end for Eiffel is available and a new tool (MergeInvariants)
for merging serialized invariant files was added.  Some modifications and
bug fixes were made to the AnnotateNullable tool and some Daikon bugs
were fixed.

Daikon

  User visible changes

    A new front end for Eiffel programs is available.  See
    http://se.inf.ethz.ch/people/polikarpova/citadel/ .

    A new tool (MergeInvariants) for merging serialized invariant files has
    been added.  See section 8.1.2 of the user manual for more information.

    The command line options for the AnnotateNullable tool have been
    slightly changed and some bugs have been fixed.  See section 8.1.5 of
    the user manual for more information.

    Daikon permits duplicate program point definitions in trace files as
    long as they have exactly the same variables as the previous definition.

  Bug fixes

    Some minor errors in the code that merges results from the program point
    hierarchy were resolved.

    A problem with suppressors that are not valid over their input
    types was fixed.  Suppressors that are not valid over their input types
    are no longer considered.  Using such suppressors could cause otherwise
    valid invariants to be missed.

----------------------------------------

4.5.0 (September 3 2008)

Kvasir was updated to create the new format for declaration records.
Kvasir was also upgraded to support newer versions of glibc.

Kvasir

  Kvasir has been updated to produce trace files using the new
  format for declaration records. This format should allow
  for future improvements with regards to readability. the old
  format can be produced using the flag "--old-decls-format"

  User visible changes

    The new declarations format has allowed for some improved handling
    for determining object invariants in C/C++. Kvasir can now produce
    object declarations for C/C++ structs. This option is, by default,
    off and can be turned on with "--parent-records"

    Kvasir's version of Valgrind has been updated to support newer versions
    of glibc. Kvasir should now support all versions of glibc supported by
    Valgrind 3.3.1(glibc 2.2-28)

  Bug fixes

    Fixed an issue with VarComparability being inserted into a dtrace file
    twice when in append mode

    Fixed an issue where C++ references were not being dereferenced
    correctly leading to memory locations to appear in trace files
    as opposed to the value being referenced

----------------------------------------

4.4.2 (August 1 2008)

Daikon's set of invariants and derived variables enabled by default was
changed to provide more relevant invariants.  Configuration options
were added for some invariants.  Bugs were fixed in Daikon and Chicory.

Daikon

  User visible changes

    The following less common invariants are no longer enabled by
    default: SubSequence, SuperSequence, FunctionBinary, NoDuplicates,
    SeqIndex, Divides, Square, ZeroTrack, BitwiseAndZero,
    BitwiseComplement, BitwiseSubset, and ShiftZero.  Their
    configuration options can be used to enable them if desired.

    Individual enable configuration options were added for the Numeric
    invariants Divides, Square, ZeroTrack, BitwiseAndZero, BitwiseComplement,
    BitwiseSubset, and ShiftZero.  Also for the Range invariants Even and
    PowerOfTwo.

    The other Range invariants (which provide information similar to the
    Upper/LowerBound and OneOf invariants and are used for non-instantiating
    suppressions) are enabled if their corresponding Bound
    or OneOf invariants are enabled.  The invariants EqualZero, EqualOne,
    EqualMinusOne, are enabled if OneOf is enabled.  The invariants
    GreaterEqualZero, GreaterEqual64, BooleanVal, and Bound0_63 are enabled
    if the Upper/LowerBound invariants are enabled.

    The Range invariants PowerOfTwo and Even will now print if they
    are enabled.  A dynamic obvious check was added so that they are
    considered obvious if there is a OneOf invariant over the same variable.

    Modified the CommonSequence invariant to not consider common sequences
    over hashcodes (pointers).  This can be overridden with the
    daikon.inv.unary.sequence.CommonSequence.hashcode_seqs configuration
    option.

  Bug Fixes

    - Fixed the Simplify output for StringLength derived variables

    - Fixed a bug where Boolean constants were not parsed correctly in
      the new declaration format

    - Any suppressions that included "result == arg1" and "arg1 == arg2"
      were augmented to include "result == arg2".  Invariants are not
      necessarily transitive due to missing variables.  Under certain
      conditions this problem could lead to an assertion failure in Daikon.

    - Fixed some problems with supporting user implementations of
      java.util.List as sequences.

Chicory

  Bug Fixes

    - Prevented unintended recursion that occurred if processing a variable
      in one dtrace record called instrumented code (e.g., calling toArray
      as part of processing a list or pure functions).  Recursive calls to
      enter() or exit() are simply ignored.

----------------------------------------

4.4.1 (July 1 2008)

A number of bugs were fixed in Daikon, Chicory, and DynComp.  The
user manual was improved.  Support for IOA format was removed from
Daikon.

Daikon

  User visible changes

    - Removed support for IOA format

  Bug fixes

    - Removed unintentional dependency on 1.6 JDK routines.  Only Java
      1.5 is required to compile or run Daikon.

  Documentation

    - Added troubleshooting section when expected invariants are not
      reported.

Chicory

  Bug fixes

    - Fixed typo in comparability type when comparability information
      is included.

DynComp

  Bug fixes

    - Fixed the classpath specification on windows to use the correct
      path specifier.

    - Changed handling of the sub-process so that stdout and stderr output
      is not mixed character by character.

    - Fixed a problem where DynComp would hang on the Mac

    - Calls to clone are now correctly handled.

  Documentation

    - Indicated that a NoSuchMethodException will be generated if a method
      in the JDK that could not be instrumented is called.

----------------------------------------

4.4.0 (June 11 2008)

A new format for declaration records in Daikon trace data was
introduced.  The AnnotateNullable tool was released.  A number
of bugs were fixed.

Daikon

  User-visible changes

    Daikon supports a new format for declaration records.  This format
    allows front ends more flexibility and an increased ability to use
    arbitrary variable names.  The program point hierarchy and relationships
    between variables are explicitly stated in their declarations rather
    than being inferred from variable names.  See Appendix A of the
    user manual for more information.

Chicory

  User-visible changes

    Creates the new declaration format by default.

AnnotateNullable

  AnnotateNullable determines which variables in a Java program were
  ever null during execution. Its primary use is for performing
  inference for a type system that detects null dereference errors. An
  example is the Nullness Checker that is part of the Checker
  Framework (see https://checkerframework.org/manual/#nullness-checker/).
  See section "AnnotateNullable" of the Daikon user manual for more
  information.

DynComp

  User-visible changes

    Enhanced the build of dcomp_rt.jar to limit expected error messages and
    make clear if any unexpected problems were encountered in the build.

  Bug-fixes

    Fixed a problem with clone where the instrumentation incorrectly added a
    call to a instrumented version of clone where it did not exist.

    Fixed some problems with the instrumentation of equals.

    Support new declaration format

----------------------------------------

4.3.5 (April 3 2008)

Daikon was enhanced to better support program points that are basic
blocks.  Also, some minor enhancements and bugs fixes were made and the
documentation was improved.

Daikon

  Bug fixes

    Permit guarding invariants (the left-hand-sides of implications) to be
    EltNonZero as well as NonZero invariants, to accommodate guarded
    invariants over array contents.

    Create better error messages when declaration records for
    expected enclosing variables for arrays are not present.

  User-visible changes

    Added IsPointer invariant.  The IsPointer invariant is true if
    the corresponding variable only takes on legitimate pointer
    values (in an x86 executable).  IsPointer is disabled by default

    Added support for program points that are basic blocks.  Using
    variables at the basic block level allows intra-procedural
    invariants (such as loop invariants) to be found.  There is
    also support for combining multiple basic blocks into a single
    program points so that invariants can be found over variables from
    different basic blocks.  See the configuration option
    daikon.FileIO.merge_basic_blocks for more information.

    Added the configuration option daikon.ProglangType.convert_to_signed
    (default false).  If true, 32 bit values whose high bit is on, are
    treated as negative numbers.

  Documentation

    The differences between a minimal and complete installation are
    better explained.  The installation instructions are improved.

    A section on removing irrelevant output was added.

    A section on using Eclipse for editing the Daikon source was added.

----------------------------------------

4.3.4 (December 1, 2007)

DynComp (Java) was enhanced with a number of new options.  It has a
new significantly faster mode where it only tracks references (and
not primitives).  It also has additional output that makes it easier
to determine where interactions occurred.

DynComp (Java)

  User-visible changes

    DynComp can now be directed, with the --no-primitives switch, to
    only track the comparability of object references, i.e. it will
    ignore primitive values.  DynComp runs significantly faster when
    only tracking references.

    DynComp has a number of new command line options that provide
    information on the source of the interactions that merge variables.

Daikon

  Bug fixes

    The JUNIT tests can now be run directly from the jar file.  All
    necessary input files are resources in the jar file and the unit test
    code handles them as resources.

----------------------------------------

4.3.3 (October 3, 2007)

A number of problems with building Daikon on Windows were resolved.
Daikon now builds correctly with Cygwin.  The installation and build
instructions were updated.

----------------------------------------

4.3.2 (September 3, 2007)

Bug fixes and minor enhancements were made to Daikon, Kvasir, and
DynComp (Java).  The "repair" output format is no longer supported
by Daikon.

Daikon

  User-visible changes

    Eliminated support for the "repair" output format.  We are not aware of
    users who are still utilizing this format; let us know if you are.

  Bug fixes

    Enhanced mainHelper (the programmatic interface to Daikon) so that
    it can be called multiple times.  This allows a caller to process
    multiple unrelated trace files within a single run.

Kvasir

  Bug fixes

    When giving the hashcode values of function parameters, previous
    versions of Kvasir sometimes used an internal pointer value. Kvasir
    now correctly uses the address on the program's stack instead. Since
    Daikon doesn't infer many invariants over hashcode values, the only
    visible effect is that the presence or absence of "<reference value>
    has only one value" invariants is more consistent.

DynComp (Java)

  Bug fixes

    Calling the superclass equals method (i.e. super.equals(Object))
    resulted in an infinite loop. This has been fixed.

    The clone method of Object is now instrumented.

4.3.1 (August 2, 2007)

Bug fixes and minor enhancements were made to Kvasir, DynComp (Java),
DynComp (binary) and Daikon.

Kvasir

  Bug fixes

    A memory leak in Kvasir's handling of variable names has been
    fixed.

  Portability

    An unneeded directory "auxprogs" whose presence caused a build
    failure on some systems has been removed.

DynComp (Binary)

  Bug fixes

    DynComp's treatment of "argc", "argv", and the environment pointer
    "environ" now works consistently across different versions of the
    C library.

    The previous version of DynComp would crash if a 64-bit program
    attempted to access memory at too large a virtual address, which
    happened on systems with certain security options enabled.  The
    range of supported addresses has been increased to 1TB, which is
    the maximum practical with the current data structure, and
    overflows are now caught with an error message.

DynComp (Java)

  Bug fixes

    The equals method of Object is now instrumented.  (The manual
    incorrectly claimed that this was the case in version 4.3.0.)

Daikon

  User-visible changes

    Added the daikon.PrintInvariants.print_filtered configuration option.
    When set to true all invariants that would have been filtered out
    are printed along with the matching filter.

    Added the daikon.Daikon.show_stack_trace configuration option.  When
    set to true, a stack trace will be printed for user/input errors that
    terminate Daikon prematurely.  Under normal circumstances, Daikon
    just prints an informative error message when such an error occurs.

    The input file and line number are printed when an incorrectly formatted
    program point name is encountered in a trace file.

  Bug Fixes

    Fixed a bug (reported by Radu Vanciu) where Daikon crashed when
    printing simplify output on some OneOfSequence invariants on a
    subsequence with a lower bound.

-------------------------------------------------

4.3.0 (July 1, 2007)

A new tool (DynComp) calculates variable comparability information
for Java programs.  Kvasir has been enhanced to support x86-64 Linux
platforms.

Daikon

  Bug fixes

    Distributed .jar and .class files are now runnable on a Java 5 (aka
    Java 1.5) JVM, rather than requiring Java 6.

Kvasir

  Portability

    Kvasir now runs on x86-64/Linux platforms: i.e., AMD64 and Intel
    64 (aka EM64T or IA32e) processors running Linux in 64-bit mode.

    We have copied into Kvasir a fix from the Valgrind development
    tree to allow Kvasir to compile on systems where gcc uses
    -fstack-protector by default, such as some recent Ubuntu
    systems. (The symptom of the problem is a linking failure
    mentioning "__stack_chk_fail".)

DynComp Java

  The DynComp tool for Java programs is available in this release.  This tool
  performs dynamic type inference to determine which variables should (and
  should not) be compared to one another when inferring invariants.  It
  can make Daikon run faster and avoid generating irrelevant invariants.
  See section 7.2 of the manual for more information.

-------------------------------------------------

4.2.16 (May 1, 2007)

This is a maintenance release with few substantive changes.

Daikon

  Bug fixes

    A bug that occurred when Daikon.jar appeared twice in the classpath
    on windows was fixed.

DtraceDiff

  User-visible changes

    Error messages are more informative.

-------------------------------------------------

4.2.15 (March 31, 2007)

Configuration-variable-related Error messages were improved.
Two bugs in Annotate, and one in the utilMDE utility package, were fixed.
The source code was made compatible with Java 6.

Daikon

  User-visible changes

    Error messages caused by bad configuration variables have been improved.

  Bug fixes

    A GCD (greatest common divisor) routine has been fixes so that it
    does not infinite-loop when called on (infinity, -infinity).

    The Annotate tool, which inserts Daikon output in source code (as
    stylized comments) has been restructured to fix two problems.
    Annotate now handles nested classes, and it recognizes (some)
    variables that Daikon intentionally omits.  These problems
    previously caused Annotate to issue a warning of the form

      Warning: Annotate: Daikon knows nothing about field ...

    which means that Annotate found a variable in the source code that was
    not processed by Daikon.

  Implementation changes

    Daikon now compiles cleanly when using Java 6.  (Java 6's compiler
    issues more warning messages than Java 5's compiler does.)

---------------------------------------

4.2.14 (February 1, 2007)

A new mode was added to Daikon that allows it to handle constants
more efficiently.  Also, a new configuration option was added
and one was renamed.

Daikon

  User-visible changes

    Daikon can now optionally ignore static constant variables during
    processing (saving space and time) and include the names of those
    constants in the output of sample dependent invariants (such
    as OneOf, LowerBound, and UpperBound).  For example, if the
    UpperBound invariant 'i < 1024' is found and a constant 'bufsize'
    with the value 1024 exists, the invariant will be printed as
    'i < bufsize'.  This mode is controlled by the configuration option
    daikon.PrintInvariants.static_const_infer.  It is not enabled by
    default.

    Normally, if a method exit is executed without a preceding enter,
    Daikon exits with an error.  If the new configuration option
    daikon.FileIO.ignore_missing_enter is set to true, the unmatched exits
    will be ignored instead.  This can make it easier to process parts
    of a dtrace file.

    The configuration option daikon.Daikon.disable_derived_variables was
    renamed to daikon.derive.Derivation.disable_derived_variables

---------------------------------------

4.2.13 (January 1, 2007)

A server mode was added to Daikon.  Two new command line switches
were added to InvariantChecker to more finely control what invariants
are checked.

InvariantChecker

  User-visible changes

    Added a switch (--conf) that checks only invariants that are above
    the default confidence level.

    Added a switch (--filter) that checks only invariants that are not
    filtered by the default filters.

Daikon

  User-visible changes

    Added a server mode for daikon (specified by the --server switch).
    In this mode, Daikon processes files that are placed in the specified
    server directory until a filename that ends in ".end" is encountered.

---------------------------------------

4.2.12 (December 1, 2006)

InvariantChecker was enhanced to handle multiple input files and count
the violations for each file. Some minor enhancements and bugs fixes
were made to Daikon.

InvariantChecker

  User-visible changes

    Added a switch (--dir) that will apply all of the samples in any
    dtrace files in the specified directory to all of the invariant
    files in the directory.  The number of samples that violated an invariant
    are reported for each invariant file.

    Only invariants above the default confidence level and that have
    not been filtered out by the default filters are checked.

Daikon

  User-visible changes

    Modified the simplify format of some invariants so that 'i' is used
    as a free variable rather than 'a'.

  Bug fixes

    The windows daikonenv.bat script was fixed to correctly handle
    paths with blanks in the directory names

    The percentage progress information was fixed to work on dtrace
    files specified with full pathnames.

---------------------------------------

4.2.11 (November 1, 2006)

Some enhancements and bug fixes were made to Daikon.  Repeated declarations
are no longer an error.  A new invariant and derived variable were added.

Daikon

  User-visible changes

    Multiple declarations of a program point are now allowed if they
    are identical to the previous declaration.  This makes it easier
    to operate on multiple trace files.

    Added an invariant (PrintableString) that is true if each character
    in a string is printable.  PrintableString is not enabled by default.

    Added a derived variable (StringLength) that represents the length
    of a string.  StringLength is not enabled by default.

    Post variables in JML output are marked as "\new" rather than generating
    a warning.

  Bug Fixes

    Simplify output now correctly references the length of synthetic
    arrays such as a[].getClass().

---------------------------------------

4.2.10 (October 2, 2006)

Some enhancements and bug fixes were made to Daikon.  Programs with a
large number of variables are handled more efficiently.  A number of
configuration options were changed.  PrintInvariants supports a new
command line option.

Daikon

  User-visible changes

    Suppression processing in Daikon has been optimized. It will
    process program points with a large number of variables more
    efficiently.  The configuration options related to suppression
    have been changed.  See the documentation for details.

    Added support for the --ppt-select-pattern command line option to
    PrintInvariant.

    By default, Daikon no longer replaces post variables with orig
    variables that have the same values.  The old behavior can be
    obtained by using the configuration option remove_post_vars.

  Bug fixes

    Previously, some information used to determine whether or not a
    variable needed to be guarded was sometimes incorrect.  This
    resulted in both unnecessary and missing guarding.  This has
    been fixed.

---------------------------------------

4.2.9 (September 1, 2006)

Bugs were fixed in Chicory, Kvasir, and Daikon.  Chicory was enhanced
to correctly instrument programs that use an incompatible version of
BCEL and to not instrument unselected classes.  Kvasir was modified to
avoid making calls to the system C library.  Using the system C library
can cause problems on some versions of Linux.

Chicory

  Chicory uses the Byte Code Engineering Library (BCEL) to instrument
  class files.  Errors can occur if the application uses an incompatible
  version of BCEL.  Chicory has been modified to identify and load its
  copy of BCEL when multiple copies of BCEL are in the class path.  It will
  also issue a warning if multiple copies of BCEL are in the class path and
  the application version is not the first one.  This behavior can be
  overridden with the default_bcel command line option

  Chicory only modifies classes that are instrumented.  Previous versions
  made unnecessary changes to uninstrumented classes.

Daikon

  The configuration option "omit_hashcode_values_Simplify" now uses
  artificial values for hashcodes that should remain consistent from run
  to run rather than omitting the invariant altogether.

  A problem where Daikon crashed when producing JML output was fixed.

Kvasir

  Kvasir has changed to use internal versions of some C standard
  library routines, and versions provided by Valgrind, rather than
  linking with the system's C library. This avoids an initialization
  problem that caused Kvasir to crash on systems whose system library
  used thread-local storage (such as some recent Fedora Core systems),
  improves portability, and conforms to the best-practice suggested by
  the Valgrind maintainers.

  The only known user-visible effect is that some floating-point
  values are now printed differently in the last digit because of
  rounding differences. The value printed generally still corresponds
  to the same internal representation, but the difference can be visible
  in Daikon's output for values of type "float", because Daikon
  represents them internally with type "double".

---------------------------------------

4.2.8 (August 1, 2006)

This is a maintenance release with few substantive changes.

Daikon

  Performance changes

    Non-instantiating suppression processing has been optimized to
    run 5 to 15% faster.

---------------------------------------

4.2.7 (July 1, 2006)

Minor enhancements were made to Chicory, Daikon, and Kvasir.  Chicory
more accurately determines whether or not a class is a boot (system)
class.  Daikon better handles spreadsheet data.  Kvasir's
DynComp option more consistently handles array references.

Chicory

  User-visible changes

    Changed the mechanism by which boot (system/jdk) classes are
    determined (boot classes are not instrumented and errors will
    occur if they are instrumented mistakenly).  Previously the name
    of the class was used.  Now if the class loader is null (which
    indicates the boot class loader), the class is presumed to be a
    boot class.  Also added a command line option (boot_classes) that
    can specify a regular expression that determines what classes are
    considered to be boot classes.

Daikon

  User-visible changes

    Daikon prints a warning message if it encounters non-standard
    program point names in a trace file and the --nohierarchy
    switch is not used.  This change is irrelevant for most users,
    since, for trace files corresponding to an execution of a program,
    such as those obtained from Chicory and Kvasir, the --nohierarchy
    switch should not be used.  For trace files obtained from
    spreadsheet data, such as from a csv file using convertcsv.pl,
    the --nohierarchy switch should be used.

    The divides invariant (b % a == 0) is redundant and thus not printed
    when a linear binary invariant of the form 'C*a = b' exists and C
    is an integer constant.

Kvasir

  User-visible changes

    DynComp's treatment of indexed memory accesses, local variables,
    and position-independent library code has been modified to be more
    consistent. The most noticeable change is that base pointers and
    indexes used in array dereferences are now always counted as
    interacting.

--------------------------------------------

4.2.6 (June 1, 2006)

This is a maintenance release with few substantive changes.

Daikon

  User-visible changes

    Daikon no longer uses the JDKDIR and DAIKONPARENT environment
    variables.

    The examples section of the Daikon manual has been slightly
    streamlined, and several small typos have been fixed.

    The examples subdirectory of the distribution has been re-organized:
    the Java examples have been put in a "java-examples" directory, and the
    "kvasir-examples" directory has been renamed to "c-examples".

    Daikon no longer prints "Creating implications", which is
    irrelevant to most users.

Kvasir

  User-visible changes

    New command-line option --array-length-limit has been added.

--------------------------------------------

4.2.5 (May 1, 2006)

Some enhancements were made to Daikon.  The list of modified and
unmodified variables in DBC and JML output is more accurate.  A
configuration option was added to control the method by which Daikon
determines variable comparability.  And the treatment of values near
zero with fuzzy comparisons has been changed.

Daikon

  User-visible changes

    Changed the way that modified/unmodified variables are determined
    in DBC and JML output.  The new version uses equality invariants
    between pre and post variables to provide more complete information.

    Added daikon.VarInfo.declared_type_comparability configuration option.
    By default, Daikon only considers variables declared with the same
    type name to be comparable.  If this option is set to false, Daikon
    does not consider the type name in determining comparability.

    Floating point values are subject to roundoff errors so Daikon
    compares them with a "fuzzy" rather than exact test.  Previously
    the test always used a relative comparison.  Under this approach a
    floating point value of 0.0 was only equal to exactly 0.0.  This
    test has been changed so that values closer to zero than the fuzzy
    ratio squared will also be considered equal to 0.0.  The fuzzy
    ratio is set via the configuration option daikon.Invariant.fuzzy_ratio

  Bug Fixes

    Fixed a bug in the Simplify formatting of index comparison invariants
    that occurred on slices starting from non-zero indices.

--------------------------------------------

4.2.4 (April 1, 2006)

This is a bug-fix release.  Several bugs in Daikon were fixed.

Daikon

  User-visible changes

    Fixed bugs in the LinearTernaryFloat and LinearBinaryFloat
    invariants such that the coefficients and constants of these
    invariants print out as decimals rather than integers.

  Bug Fixes

    Fixed an error in LinearTernary invariant that showed up when
    merging LinearTernary invariant that formed lines rather than
    planes.

    Fixed a problem in the equality set optimization that caused
    variables with NaN values to show up as equal (Java considers a
    NaN value to be unequal to everything, including itself or another
    NaN value).

    Fixed InvariantChecker so that it works correctly with trace files
    that contain declaration records.

--------------------------------------------

4.2.3 (March 1, 2006)

This is a bug-fix release.  It also adds a new, more detailed mode to
the x86 DynComp tool.

Daikon

  User-visible changes

    Changed the default value of configuration parameter
    daikon.PptRelation.enable_object_user from "true" to "false".

Chicory

  User-visible changes

    Fixed bugs in operation of --purity-file and in --omit-var
    switches.

Kvasir

  User-visible changes

    Added a --dyncomp-detailed-mode command-line option to provide
    more detailed (accurate) but slower DynComp variable comparability
    analysis.

  Implementation changes

    Ported Kvasir to use a recent development version of Valgrind
    3.2.0 from the Feb. 10, 2006 snapshot of the Subversion
    repository.

--------------------------------------------

4.2.2 (February 1, 2006)

Enhancements were made to the Chicory and Kvasir front ends.
Chicory allows a regular expression to choose variables to be
omitted by name and has some new and modified command line options.
Kvasir has some new command line options to better control its
comparability analysis.

Chicory

  User-visible changes

    The --omit-var <regex> command line option was added.  Variables whose
    name matches the regular expression will be omitted from the trace file.

    The option --daikon-args must be used to specify any arguments to
    daikon when it is automatically run with the --daikon or --daikon-online
    options.  The --daikon and --daikon-online options no longer accept
    an argument

    The option --trace-percent has been removed and replaced with  the
    --sample_start option.  The --sample_start option starts sampling after
    the specified number of samples have been recorded.  The sampling
    percentage decreases as more samples are recorded.

    The option --comparability-file was added to specify a decl
    formatted file with comparability information.

    Static variables are only included once at each program point.  Static
    variables are named with their full static pathname (for example:
    package.class.varname) rather than their relative name (this.varname)

Kvasir

  User-visible changes

    Added several command-line options (--dyncomp-units,
    --dyncomp-dataflow-only, --dyncomp-dataflow-comp) to provide
    finer user control over the DynComp comparability analysis tool,
    which is distributed along with Kvasir.

--------------------------------------------

4.2.1 (January 1, 2006)

Enhancements were made to the Mangel-Wurzel and Kvasir front ends.
Mangel-Wurzel better supports arrays, C++, and regular expressions for
specifying program point names.  Some Kvasir command line
options were updated.

Mangel-Wurzel

  Enhancements

    The Windows version now includes full support for regular expression
    matching in --ppt-omit-pattern and --ppt-select-pattern command-line
    options.  The --dtrace-gzip option is also now fully supported.

    Sending dtrace output to stdout now works.

    Output for statically-sized, multidimensional arrays is now supported.
    There are new command-line options --flatten-arrays,
    --max-flatten-array-size, and --max-array-size to control how arrays
    are output.

  Bug fixes

    Some minor bugs in array output have been fixed.

    C++ support has been better tested, with bug fixes added for reference
    parameters and return values, and proper scoping of exit PPT processing
    with respect to binding and destruction of block-scope variables.

    Code with multiple return statements on the same line no longer results
    in duplicate exit PPT names.

Kvasir

  User-visible changes

    The --limit-static-vars command line option was removed.  The default
    behavior now only outputs static variables at program points for
    the file that contains the static variable.  The new option
    --all-static-vars outputs static variables at all program points.

--------------------------------------------

4.2.0 (December 6, 2005)

Daikon's support for C and C++ has been substantially improved.  The
Mangel-Wurzel C/C++ front end now runs on Windows, and it supports new
option --ignore-system-structs.  The Kvasir C/C++ front end has
greatly improved support for C++, it supports a new pointer type
coercion feature, and it makes use of the new Fjalar dynamic
instrumentation framework.

The Purity Analysis Kit can determine which methods of your program
are pure observer methods, and so can be treated as derived variables.
Many small improvements to Daikon's output have been made (but most
users will only notice small changes to the output).


Daikon

  User-visible changes

    The shell configuration files (daikon.bashrc, daikon.cshrc,
    daikonenv.bat) do better checking of whether the user has set the
    required configuration variables.

    Errors in the Windows configuration file (daikonenv.bat) have been
    corrected.

    The default ("Daikon") output format has been made more Java-like.
    As one example,
      this.theArray.class == "java.lang.Object[]"
    now prints as
      this.theArray.getClass() == java.lang.Object[].class

    Daikon's comparability tests, which determine what variables may
    be compared to one another (and so may co-occur in an invariant)
    have been improved.

    Daikon outputs fewer logically redundant invariants.  (For
    instance, the tests that suppress, from the output, method
    invariants when a stronger invariant occurs as an object
    invariant, have been improved.)

  Implementation detail

    Guarding (controlled by the Daikon.guardNulls config option) has
    been completely re-implemented.

    The Daikon regression tests (not included in the distribution due
    to size, but available on request) have been made easier to use.
    In particular, they now require only two environment variables to
    be set, and set all other environment variables appropriately.

  Documentation changes

    The installation instructions have been modified to reflect the
    fact that the environment variable DAIKONDIR, rather than its
    parent DAIKONPARENT, is the preferred setting for the user to
    configure.

Annotate

  Bug fixes

    Annotate can now locate all Daikon variables that correspond to
    class fields.  This improves the output and eliminates a warning
    message.

Kvasir

  User-visible changes

     C++ support is greatly improved.  New features include support
     for inheritance (printing out superclass member variables),
     reference parameter variables, member function declarations both
     within and outside of class bodies, and more consistent naming of
     C++ function and variable names (enabling proper handling of
     OBJECT program points by Daikon).

     Simplified the format of the program point list (ppt-list) files.

     Added a pointer type coercion feature.  A user can specify in a
     .disambig file the actual type of a pointer with some other
     declared type.  This is useful for obtaining fields of pointers
     that are declared as void*.

  Implementation changes

     Re-factored all of the Kvasir and DynComp code to use the Fjalar
     framework.  Fjalar is a C/C++ dynamic analysis framework.  The
     new directory structure reflects the separation between the
     Fjalar framework and the Kvasir and DynComp tools that are built
     upon the framework.

  Documentation changes

     The Daikon User Manual describes C++ support in more detail.

Mangel-Wurzel

  Enhancements

    Mangel-Wurzel now runs on Microsoft Windows as a command-line utility
    with the Microsoft Visual C/C++ compiler.  (Mangel-Wurzel does not
    support GCC on this platform.)

    Some minor changes have been made to the way Mangel-Wurzel looks for
    include files and libraries.

    There is a new command-line option, --ignore-system-structs, to ignore
    fields of structs defined in system include files.  (Typically, ordinary
    users have no need to examine the internals of structures like FILE that
    are defined as interfaces to the underlying operating system.)

Chicory

  User-visible changes

    The command line option --avoid-static-recursion was removed.  Chicory
    will now traverse the static fields of a give class at most once by
    default.

    The trace file now contains the contents of the --ppt-select-pattern
    and --ppt-omit-pattern switches as comments near the end of the file.

    Chicory issues a warning if the result of the settings for the
    --ppt-omit-pattern and --ppt-select-pattern switches don't match any
    program points.  It also complains if no records are printed to the
    trace file (which can happen even if some methods match if those methods
    are never executed)

Purity Analysis Kit

  The Purity Analysis Kit computes which methods of a Java program are pure
  (have no externally visible side effects).  The Purity Analysis Kit now
  includes a command-line option, --daikon-purity-file, that causes it to
  write a file that is appropriate for passing to Chicory via its
  --purity-file option.  The Purity Analysis Kit was written by Alexandru
  Salcianu and is available from http://www.mit.edu/~salcianu/purity/.

--------------------------------------------

4.1.7 (November 1 2005)

Enhancements were made to the Kvasir, Mangel-Wurzel and Chicory front
ends.  Kvasir and Mangel-Wurzel both handle arrays of structures and
pointers better than previously.  The command line options for Chicory
were standardized.  The documentation of each was reorganized and updated.
Daikon has some new and enhanced configuration options.

Daikon

  User-visible changes

    Config option "Daikon.noInvariantGuarding" has been renamed to
    "Daikon.guardNulls", and instead of being a boolean, is a
    string with three possible values:  "always", "never", or "missing".
    See the documentation for details.

    Added daikon.inv.unary.sequence.SingleSequence.SeqIndexDisableAll
    configuration option to disable all of the SeqIndex invariants
    (SeqIndexIntEqual, SeqIndexFloatLessThan, etc).

    Added DerivedVariableFilter that will filter out invariants that
    use a specific class of derived variable.  See the configuration
    option daikon.inv.filter.DerivedVariableFilter.class_re for more
    information.

Chicory

  Bug fixes

    Fixed a bug (reported by Christoph Csallner) where Chicory crashed
    when the --std-vis (now std-visibility) switch was used and a field
    was accessed in a non-instrumented class (in this case an
    interface).

  Enhancements

    Chicory's switches were renamed for consistency as follows:

        --configs                   is now --config-dir
        --heap_size                 is now --heap-size
        --std-vis                   is now --std-visibility
        --watch-static-recursion    is now --avoid-static-recursion

    The --trace-percent switch now takes a floating point argument
    The documentation was also updated to provide a better explanation
    of the switches.

Kvasir

  Enhancements

     Implemented a more robust data structure traversal mechanism
     that can better handle dereferencing pointer fields inside of
     arrays and arrays of structures.

  Documentation changes

     Re-organized and updated the Kvasir section in the Daikon User
     Manual.  Updated examples, added categories for command-line
     options, and added a section describing the DynComp dynamic
     comparability analysis tool that comes with Kvasir.

Mangel-Wurzel

   Bug fixes

     Fixed a bug that was causing wurzel to crash when processing switch
     statements followed by an implicit return.

   Enhancements

     Some of the mangel configuration options have changed to make it
     easier to set up at installation time.  Most options now get their
     defaults from reading an options file instead of through environment
     variables.  See the Daikon manual for details.

     There are new command-line options for mangel to directly specify
     strict ANSI, gcc, and Microsoft compatibility modes.

     Instrumented programs now run much faster due to improvements in the
     Mangel-Wurzel runtime.

     Arrays of structs are now treated as arrays of each scalar struct field
     (instead of being ignored), as in the other Daikon front ends.


--------------------------------------------

4.1.6 (October 1 2005)

A number of bug fixes and minor enhancements have been made to the
Mangel-Wurzel, Kvasir, and Chicory front ends.  The older front
ends dfec and dfej have been removed from the distribution.

Mangel-Wurzel

  Printing of string variable values has been fixed to do a better job of
  distinguishing between null-terminated strings, and arrays of arbitrary
  byte values or pointers to a single character object.

Kvasir

  Bug fixes

    A memory allocation problem that caused Kvasir to crash in some
    Linux environments, including Red Hat version 9, has been worked
    around. To catch such problems more quickly in the future, we now
    regularly test Kvasir on four Linux distribution versions.

    Added support for giving names to unnamed struct/union/enum types
    and fixed bugs that prevented Kvasir from traversing into
    certain structs within large programs with many files which include
    the definitions of those structs.

    Improved the garbage collector for DynComp comparability analysis
    to allow it to scale up to larger programs.

Daikon

  Manual

    The description of program point names and variable names has been
    improved, consolidating several different discussions and clarifying
    the interpretation of arrays.

  Implementation detail

    The Daikon code no longer uses any raw generic types.  All uses of
    generic types (such as List) are supplied a type parameter.  When
    compiled using the supplied Makefile, there are no "javac -Xlint"
    warnings.

Chicory

  Added command line options --trace-percent (only output the specified
  percentage of program points) and --watch-static-recursion (only
  output a particular static once).

Removed components

  We have reduced the size of the Daikon distribution by removing several
  un-needed or out-of-date components.

  Eclipse plug-in

    The Eclipse plug-in is no longer being maintained, so it has been
    removed from the manual.  We hope to re-include this when the plug-in
    gets updated again.

  dfec

    Dfec has been removed from the Daikon distribution and the manual.  To
    run Daikon on C/C++ programs, we use Kvasir (for Linux/x86) or
    Mangel-Wurzel (for all other platforms).

  dfej

    Dfej has been removed from the Daikon distribution and the manual.  to
    run Daikon on Java programs, use Chicory.

  Ajax

    The Ajax package for computing comparability of variables in Java
    programs has been removed from the distribution and the manual.  It
    only works with Java 1.1 and is the bottleneck in running dfej.  A
    replacement is in testing and will be included in a future release.

----------------

4.1.5 (September 1 2005)

A new source-based C/C++ front end, Mangel-Wurzel, is now available.
Mangel-Wurzel uses Rational Purify to determine the validity and extent
of pointers.  A license for Purify is required.  The initial version
is available only for Linux/86, but future versions are planned for
Windows and possibly other platforms.  Kvasir will remain the suggested
C/C++ front end for Linux/86.

Mangel-Wurzel

  More information is available in the 'Mangel-Wurzel' section of the
  Daikon User Manual.

Kvasir

  Bug fixes

    Optimized initialization code to greatly reduce start-up time when
    running Kvasir on large programs.


----------------

4.1.4 (August 1 2005)

Kvasir and Chicory have been enhanced with new command line options,
improved performance and documentation.  Kvasir can more efficiently
trace a subset of a program.  Chicory supports pure functions as
additional Daikon variables.  Also, Daikon problems are now tracked in
a Bugzilla database.

General

  Daikon problems are now tracked in the Bugzilla database at at:
  http://pag.csail.mit.edu/bugzilla/.  There are separate products for
  Daikon and Kvasir.  Problems with Chicory and other front ends
  should be submitted against the Daikon product.

Daikon

  User Changes

    Daikon runs on MacOS (the Apple Macintosh).  This is not due to a
    change in Daikon, but because Apple has finally released a Java 1.5
    JVM.

  Bug fixes

    Fixed several bugs in Annotate, the program that inserts Daikon's
    output into source code as comments.  This eliminates errors reported
    by the JML syntax checker (available at http://www.jmlspecs.org/).

Chicory

  User changes:

    The values of static variables in classes that are not initialized
    are no longer included in the trace file.  Instead, the trace file
    notes them as nonsensical until the class is initialized.

    Added the --purity-file=<file> switch.  Chicory will read <file>
    for pure methods (methods which do not induce side effects).  It
    will then invoke these methods, using their return values as
    normal variables.  That is, if a class has variables int a, b, c,
    and pure method int x(), then Chicory will produce variables a,b,c
    and x() for Objects of this type.

    Added --std-vis switch.  When on, Chicory will only traverse fields which
    are visible from a given program point.  For instance, a program point from
    class A will not include private fields from class B.

    Added --heap_size switch to specify the maximum heap size of the target
    program.

    See the Chicory section of the Daikon user manual for more information.

  Bug Fixes

    Overriding methods that return a subtype of the original method no
    longer produce duplicate decl information.

    Arrays of objects with String fields are now handled correctly.

  Documentation changes:

    Documented --premain switch to Chicory.  Noted that the default output file
    for Chicory is . (not ./daikon-output).

Kvasir

  User changes:

    The selective program point and variable tracing functionality
    (--ppt-list-file and --var-list-file options, respectively) now
    work more efficiently and reliably than before, and can integrate
    with the pointer type disambiguation functionality (--disambig).

    Grant the user the ability to comment-out lines in the program point
    and variable list files by placing a '#' character at the beginning
    of lines.

    Added a --smart-disambig option to allow Kvasir to heuristically
    infer pointer type information when generating a disambiguation file.

  Documentation Changes

    Added "Tracing only part of a program" and "Using pointer type
    disambiguation with partial program tracing" entries to the Kvasir
    section of the Daikon User Manual.

----------------

4.1.3 (July 1 2005)

The dynamic comparability analysis in Kvasir has been improved (it
indicates which variables interact with one another).  Switch
--var-select-pattern has been added to Daikon, and a variety of bugs have
been fixed and enhancements performed.

Daikon

  User changes:

    Added new switch --var-select-pattern for symmetry with
    --var-omit-pattern.  Daikon produces output only for variables whose
    names match the regular expression.

    Configuration option daikon.FileIO.unmatched_procedure_entries_quiet
    defaults to false, and its output has been made more concise.

    Improved Daikon's diagnostics that indicate it was provided no program
    points, variables, or samples.

Kvasir

  User changes:

    The DynComp variable comparability analysis tool (invoked by using
    the --with-dyncomp option) generates much more precise
    comparability sets.

    The --dyncomp-fast-mode command-line option makes DynComp run
    faster and use less memory at the expense of slightly less
    precision (by adjusting the handling of manifest literals).

    Added a tag garbage collector to DynComp, to avoid running out of
    memory on larger programs.  The --no-dyncomp-gc option turns off
    the garbage collector, and the --gc-num-tags=N option tells
    DynComp to garbage collect after every N tags have been assigned
    (default is 5,000,000).  If your program still runs out of memory
    while running Kvasir with DynComp, try the --dyncomp-fast-mode
    option.

---------------------------------

4.1.2 (June 1 2005)

Kvasir can now produce variable comparability information, Chicory can now
run Daikon online (without writing any files to disk), and the new
DtraceDiff program can be used to compare Daikon trace files.

Kvasir

  User changes:

    New --with-dyncomp option adds variable comparability information
    to .decls files.  Variable comparability information indicates
    which variables should (and should not) be compared to one another
    when inferring invariants; it can make Daikon run faster and avoid
    generating irrelevant invariants.  This option may be used with
    the --decls-only option to generate a .decls file without a
    .dtrace file.

  Implementation changes:

    Kvasir now uses a development version of Valgrind 3.0 instead of
    the release version of Valgrind 2.2.  This should have no
    user-visible effects.

Chicory

  User changes:

    Added --daikon-online option.  Behavior is similar to that of the
    --daikon option, but instead of writing and reading back a dtrace
    file, Chicory and Daikon communicate directly via a socket.  This
    can avoid creation of large temporary .dtrace files on disk, and
    can make Daikon run faster.

DtraceDiff

  New:

    This is a new utility to compare data trace (.dtrace) files using
    a content-based, rather than text-based, comparison.

    Invoke it like
      java daikon.tools.DtraceDiff [DECLS1]... DTRACE1 [DECLS2]... DTRACE2
    See the usage message or Daikon manual for information about
    additional command-line options.

    DtraceDiff stops by signalling an error when it finds a difference
    between the two data trace files.  (Once execution paths have
    diverged, continuing to emit record-by-record differences is
    likely to produce output that is far too voluminous to be useful.)
    It also signals an error when it detects incompatible program
    point declarations or when one file is shorter than the other.

Daikon:

  Implementation changes:

    Java-family formats now use reflection to access fields.  This
    makes it possible to access non-public fields.  The Quant helper
    methods do not throw exceptions when given illegal arguments.

    Runtime-check instrumenter can emit "invariant-checker" classes.

---------------------------------

4.1.1 (May 1 2005)

This is primarily a maintenance release with bug fixes to Kvasir and
Chicory.

Kvasir

  User changes:

    Added --bit-level-precision command-line option for more accurate
    output of variables involved in bit-level operations.

  Bug fixes:

    Kvasir achieves better accuracy because it is now able to find
    arrays and other structs nested within structs (which are local
    and global variables) and only prints out initialized data within
    arrays.

Chicory

  Bug fixes:

    Chicory no longer changes the order in which classes are initialized.

Dfec

  User changes:

    Because of their size, the C examples for dfec are no longer included
    in the distribution.  Examples for Kvasir (the recommended C front end)
    are still available.

---------------------------------

4.1.0 (Apr 1 2005)

Daikon now supports C++:  it is possible to infer invariants over C++
programs, using the Kvasir front end.  (Kvasir works on Linux/x86 systems.)
As usual, many bugs have been corrected, and in particular, Kvasir has been
made much more robust.  The Daikon manual has been copy-edited and
reorganized for clarity.

Daikon

  User changes

    When using the --ppt-select-pattern option to Chicory, it is no longer
    necessary to write two regular expressions, one of which matches the
    class and another of which matches the procedure.  This makes the
    option more consistent with similar argument to other parts of the
    toolset, and with the --ppt-omit-pattern argument.

  Documentation changes

    The Daikon manual has been cleaned up and copy-edited (e.g., for
    consistent use of punctuation and typographical conventions).  A few
    sections have been reorganized, and some redundant material has been
    eliminated.  These changes should make the manual more readable.

Kvasir

  User changes

    In order to reduce the amount of extraneous output, added heuristics
    to avoid dereferencing pointers to certain types of variables
    (such as FILE*) associated with the C library and operating
    system which are unlikely to be interesting for the user.

    Added C++ support:

      Features:

        Kvasir outputs the member variables of C++ classes just like those
	within C structs, generates :::OBJECT and :::CLASS invariants,
	performs C++ name demangling, treats member functions like regular
	functions with an extra 'this' pointer parameter, and outputs
	static class member variables.

      Limitations:

	Kvasir does not print the contents of classes defined in external
        libraries.  For example, Kvasir outputs the contents of a char*,
        but not the contents of the C++ string class.

        Kvasir ignores classes in which any member function definition
        appears within the class body.  Kvasir only produces output for
        classes all of whose member function definitions appear outside the
        class body.

        Support for inheritance and polymorphic member function calls have
        not yet been tested.

  Bug fixes

    Fixed a variety of segmentation faults in Kvasir.  Kvasir now runs on
    programs of significant size (for example, gcc 3.4.3, which is over
    300,000 lines of code).

---------------------------------

4.0.3 (Mar 1 2005)

This version includes significant improvements to the manual, enhancements
to Kvasir, and bug fixes.  Version 3.1.10 of the Daikon plug-in for Eclipse
is also now available.

Daikon

  Documentation changes

    The Daikon manual has been improved in the following ways:
     * Two new sections in "Troubleshooting" chapter: "Too much output" and
       "No samples".
     * Kvasir (C front end) section has been restructured for clarity.
     * Descriptions of file formats have been clarified.

    The instrumentation (front end) sections of the Daikon Developer
    Manual have been expanded, and in particular a new section about how
    to instrument C programs has been added.

Kvasir

  Bug Fixes

    Kvasir now compiles on older versions of gcc such as 2.96.

---------------------------------

4.0.2 (Feb 19 2005)

Daikon

  User changes

    The manual includes a new section "minimal installation":  users who
    want to detect invariants only in Java programs merely need to put
    daikon.jar on their class path.

    By default, Daikon creates .inv.gz files containing a serialized
    representation of the invariants.  Previously, you had to specify the
    -o flag.  You can still specify -o to override the default name.

  Developer changes

    The developer manual discusses issues related to calling System.exit().

dfej

  User changes

    Ajax is disabled by default.  You can control it with the --ajax and
    --no-ajax flags.

    dfej creates compressed trace files (.dtrace.gz) by default.  You can
    still explicitly specify the name of the trace file.

  Documentation changes

    Documented that environment variable DTRACELIMITTERMINATE causes an
    exception to be thrown when the .dtrace file reaches the specified
    size; it does not forcibly terminate the program.

Chicory

  User changes

    Changed behavior of environment variable DTRACELIMITTERMINATE to cause
    an exception to be thrown when the .dtrace file reaches the specified
    size, rather than forcibly terminating the program.

  Bug fixes

    Correct a problem with classes that are not in a package; Chicory
    previously created invalid program point names for the constructors of
    such programs.

    Correct a problem with outputting values of type "char".

---------------------------------

4.0.1 (Feb 13 2005)

Daikon

  The manual has been restructured and simplified, in order to clarify that
  the Chicory and Kvasir front ends (for Java and C, respectively) are
  preferred over the older dfej and dfec front ends.

  A number of problems with the Chicory instrumenter were fixed.  In
  particular, files necessary to run Chicory (when not running from
  source) were added to the distribution.

  Configuration option daikon.FileIO.unmatched_procedure_entries_quiet is
  now true by default.

  Invariants over typeOf derived variables are disabled in the instrumenter
  and Annotate's output.

Kvasir

  User Changes

    Kvasir now produces all of its output (both variable declarations and
    runtime values) in one .dtrace file instead of as separate .decls and
    .dtrace files.  The --decls-file=<filename> command-line option forces
    Kvasir to generate separate .decls and .dtrace files, as before.

  Bug Fixes

    Several refinements which produce better output for arrays and structs
    when using pointer type disambiguation.  Also fixed some bugs, making
    Kvasir more robust across different Linux platforms (kernel and gcc
    version differences).

Eclipse plug-in

  Version 3.1.10 of the Daikon plug-in for Eclipse (written by David Cok)
  has been released.  It is compatible with Daikon version 3.1.7 (which is
  included with the plug-in), but with dfej version 4 (which can be
  downloaded from the Daikon webpage).  A version of the plug-in that is
  fully compatible with Daikon 4 is still in preparation.

---------------------------------

4.0.0 (Feb 7 2005)

The 4.0.0 version of Daikon introduces many substantial enhancements.
These improvements include:
 * Liberalized license permits unrestricted use.
 * New Java class file front end ("Chicory") handles Java 5.0 (and earlier).
 * Annotation and other source manipulation components handle Java 5.0.
 * New Eclipse plug-in eases running many components of the Daikon system.
 * New runtime checking tool can insert assertions into your programs.
 * Command-line options have been standardized across Daikon components.
 * Many bug fixes, documentation updates, and other minor improvements.

License

  Daikon's licensing terms have been liberalized.  Daikon is now distributed
  without restrictions under an MIT/BSD-style license.

Chicory:  class file-based front end for Java

  Chicory is a new Daikon front end for Java.  Its functionality is very
  similar to that of the dfej tool, and it supports most of the same
  command-line options.  However, Chicory has three substantial advantages
  over dfej:
   * Chicory is much easier to use:  when running your Java program,
     just replace the "java" command with "java daikon.Chicory".  For
     instance, if you usually run
       java mypackage.MyClass arg1 arg2 arg3
     then instead you would run
       java daikon.Chicory mypackage.MyClass arg1 arg2 arg3
     That's all there is to it!  Note that Chicory does not require you to
     perform separate instrumentation or compilation steps, as dfej does.
     Furthermore, a single command can both create trace files and run Daikon:
       java daikon.Chicory --daikon mypackage.MyClass arg1 arg2 arg3
     See the Daikon manual for more options.
   * Chicory supports all versions of Java, including Java 5.0.  By
     contrast, dfej only supports Java 1.4 and earlier.
   * Chicory is platform-independent (and requires no special action to
     build), since it is written in Java.

Eclipse plug-in

  Daikon is now accompanied by an Eclipse plug-in (written by David Cok)
  that provides the functionality of instrumenting files, obtaining trace
  information, analyzing those traces, and creating appropriately annotated
  Java source code. The plug-in works with Eclipse version 3.0.1 and later.
  You can find documentation for the plug-in at
  http://pag.csail.mit.edu/daikon/doc/daikonHelp.html .
  The 3.1.7 version of the plug-in supports versions of Daikon up to Daikon
  3.1.7 and (like Eclipse 3.0.1) only versions of Java up to Java 1.4.2.
  A version of the plug-in for Eclipse 3.1 and Daikon 4.0.0 is forthcoming.

Daikon

  User changes

    Daikon now permits program point declarations (which previously
    appeared only in .decls files) to appear in the .dtrace file as well.
    Each declaration must appear either in a .decls file or in a .dtrace
    file, not in both, and any declaration in a .dtrace file must precede
    all samples for that program point.  This feature allows incremental
    processing of .dtrace files for languages such as Java that support
    dynamic linking.  As part of this change, it is now required that
    :::ENTER program points be declared before corresponding :::EXIT
    program points so that the set of original variables are available when
    processing exit point declarations.

    The generation of implications has been modified.  If Daikon finds
    multiple invariants with identical run-time truth values, one is chosen
    as a predicate and used for all of the implications.  For example,
    suppose that all of the following implications are true, where the
    letters stand for invariants:
      A <=> B
      A  => C
      A  => D
      B  => C
      B  => D
    Previously, Daikon would print all of these implications.  Now, it
    prints only the first three, since the last two are redundant and can
    be inferred from the first three.

    The following command-line options have been renamed, for consistency
    with other components of the Daikon distribution.
      OLD              NEW
      --ppt RE         --ppt-select-pattern=RE
      --ppt_omit RE    --ppt-omit-pattern=RE
      --var_omit RE    --var-omit-pattern=RE

  Developer changes

    Daikon's source code is now written in Java version 5.0.  This means
    that you will need a Java 5 compiler to compile Daikon, and you will
    need a Java 5 JVM to run Daikon.  (You may be able to run Daikon on an
    older JVM by using a utility like retroweaver:
    http://retroweaver.sourceforge.net/ .)

dfej

  The dfej front end for Java continues to support only Java 1.4 and
  earlier.  You can run dfej's output on any JVM, but dfej takes as input a
  Java 1.4 (or earlier) program.

  dfej outputs more variables; in particular, you may notice slightly more
  "foo.class" variables that give the run-time type of variable foo.

  The following command-line options have been renamed, for consistency
  with other components of the Daikon distribution.
    OLD                         NEW
    -daikon_debug               --debug
    -daikon_depth=              --nesting-depth=
    +daikon_instrument          --instrument
    -daikon_instrument          --no-instrument
    +daikon_listclosure         --linked-lists
    -daikon_listclosure         --no-linked-lists
    +daikon_exceptions          --exceptions
    -daikon_exceptions          --no-exceptions
    -daikon_includeonly=/RE/    --ppt-select-pattern=RE
    -daikon_omit=/RE/           --ppt-omit-pattern=RE
    -noajax                     --no-ajax
    -tracefilename=             --dtrace-file=
    -declsfiledir=              --decls-dir=
    -declsfiledirflat=          --decls-flat --decls-dir=
    -instrsourcedir=            --instr-dir=

Annotate

  Annotate and other components of Daikon (including runtimechecker,
  described below) handle Java 5.0 code.  They continue to support all
  earlier versions of Java as well.

  Annotate respects tabs in the source file.  Previously, Annotate
  converted tabs to spaces.

Runtime-check instrumenter

  A runtime-check instrumenter (named "runtimechecker") has been added to
  Daikon.  The instrumenter creates a new version of Java source code; the
  modified version checks invariants as the program executes.  For more
  details, see the "tools" section in the Daikon manual.

  The runtime-check instrumenter may be useful for external tools.  It is
  used, for example, by the Eclat tool (which is not a part of Daikon
  itself).  Eclat automatically creates test cases that are much more
  likely than random to reveal errors in programs.  You can download Eclat
  from http://pag.csail.mit.edu/eclat/ .

Kvasir

  User Changes

    Added a command-line option, --limit-static-vars, to limit the output
    of static variables.

    Added pointer-type disambiguation (--disambig and --disambig-file
    options), which permits users to specify whether pointers are printed
    as single elements or arrays.

    Kvasir does not yet support C++.  If support for C++ is important to
    you, please send email to daikon-developers@lists.csail.mit.edu.

  Bug Fixes

    Numerous bug fixes result in Kvasir producing more accurate output,
    most exposed only by obscure test cases.

dfepl

  The following command-line options have been renamed, for consistency
  with other components of the Daikon distribution.
    OLD                  NEW
    --reference-depth=   --nesting-depth=
    --dtrace-basedir=    --dtrace-dir=
    --decls-basedir=     --decls-dir=
    --instr-basedir=     --instr-dir=

---------------------------------

3.1.7 (Jan 1 2005)

This version includes some improvements to the website, documentation
enhancements and several bug fixes.

Daikon

  Documentation Changes

    The Daikon publications webpage has been reorganized to bring all of
    the publications relating to Daikon together on a single webpage.
    Links have been added to other tools that perform dynamic invariant
    detection.  See http://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/pubs/.

    The list of configuration options in the user manual was reorganized
    to group the options by category.

  Bug Fixes

    An incorrect assertion that caused Daikon to fail on some inputs
    was fixed.  Some other minor problems were resolved as well.

---------------------------------

3.1.6 (Dec 1 2004)

Daikon

  User Changes

    Daikon now has improved support for reading trace data from the
    standard input or a named pipe.  Together with the enhancement to
    the Kvasir C front end allowing writing to a pipe, this removes the
    need for an intermediate trace file, allowing Daikon to operate on
    larger or longer-running programs. For more details, see
    the "Reading trace data on the fly" section of the manual.

    The printing filters were simplified and configuration
    options were added to enable/disable each filter.  See the
    "Invariant Filters" and "List of Configuration Options" sections
    of the manual for more information.  Filter configuration
    options are named 'daikon.inv.filter.<filter>.enabled'.

    The user manual was enhanced with a section ('Loop invariants')
    that describes how to find specific loop invariants if desired.

    The configuration option 'daikon.FileIO.dtrace_line_count' was
    added.  This option allows the number of lines in the dtrace
    file to be specified and avoids the overhead of having Daikon
    counting them.

    Daikon no longer uses the libraries jarkarta-oro.jar and log4j.

    The mechanism for compiling splitter files was improved.
    The process is more reliable, error messages are more
    meaningful and the names of related configuration options
    were changed.  The option that selects the compiler to use is
    'daikon.split.SplitterFactory.compiler' and the option that sets
    the compiler timeout is 'daikon.split.SplitterFactory.compile_timeout'.

  Developer Changes

    Sections were added to the developer manual explaining regression
    testing and how to analyze historical versions of Daikon.

Dfej

  Bug Fixes

    A bug that could cause errors in programs that used variables
    named "ps", "depth", or "prefix" was fixed.

Kvasir

  User Changes

    Kvasir now supports writing to a pipe. Used with Daikon's new
    support for reading from a pipe, this removes the need for an
    intermediate trace file, allowing Daikon to operate on larger or
    longer-running programs.  For more details, see the "Reading trace
    data on the fly" section of the manual.

    The Kvasir C front end now supports a number of command line options
    for controlling what output is produced and where it is written. See
    the "Kvasir options" section of the user manual for a list.

  Bug Fixes

    A number of bugs in Kvasir have been fixed, including one that
    accidentally reduced the number of program points it output, and
    another that caused arrays to have too many elements.  On the
    whole, Kvasir produces significantly more output than before.

---------------------------------

3.1.5 (Nov 1 2004)

Daikon

  User Changes

    When two or more variables are always equal, any invariant that is
    true over one variable is true over all of the variables.  Daikon
    prints invariants only over one variable (the leader) from the
    equal set.  The algorithm used for choosing the leader has been
    improved.  A variable that is less derived is chosen ahead of one
    that is more derived.  Variables derived from parameters are
    chosen last.  And other things being equal, the variable with the
    least complex name is chosen first.

    Two new options were added.  The --list_type option specifies
    information to be added to the "ListImplementors" section of the
    .decls file.  The --mem_stat option prints memory usage statistics
    info a file named "stat.out" in the current directory.  The
    "Command line options for Daikon" section of the users manual
    was also reorganized to be more clear.

    The configuration option "Daikon.disable_derived_variables" was
    added.  Derived variables will not be created if this option is set to
    true.  See the "List of Configuration Options" section of the user
    manual for more information.

  Bug Fixes

    Two bugs were fixed in the LinearTernary invariant.  Under some
    conditions, LinearTernary invariants were reported when there were
    samples that did not fit.  Also, coefficients too large for an
    integer were printed incorrectly.

  Developer Changes

    Daikon warns if you (incorrectly) use "String" in a .decls file,
    as a representation type synonym for "java.lang.String".  The use
    of "String[]" was and continues to be an error, but now gives a
    more specific message.  The C front ends dfec (distributed
    separately) and Kvasir have been updated accordingly.

Kvasir (C front end)

  User Changes

    The dynamic C front end Kvasir has been extensively improved.  It
    is now based on the stable 2.2.0 release of Valgrind, fixing
    failures on some Linux distributions.  Global variables are now
    instrumented, and there is some support for outputting array
    values.  Changes have been made to allow instrumenting C programs
    compiled with a C++ compiler (work to support C++ itself is
    ongoing).  Two incompatibilities with previous versions of Kvasir
    should be noted: the format of global function names has changed,
    for consistency with the new names for global variables, and
    Kvasir may now produce much more output for a given program run.

  Developer Changes

    Kvasir now uses "java.lang.String" rather than "String" as the
    representation type for strings in .decls files (see "Daikon
    Developer Changes" in this file).

Dfec (C font end)

  Developer Changes

    Dfec now uses "java.lang.String" rather than "String" as the
    representation type for strings in .decls files (see "Daikon
    Developer Changes" in this file).

Dfepl (Perl front end)

  Bug Fixes

    An incompatibility between dfepl, the Perl front end, and versions
    of Perl starting with 5.8.1 has been fixed.  Dfepl has been
    verified to work with Perl version 5.8.4.

Scripts

  User Changes

    Added new script trace-add-nonces.pl, which adds nonces to a
    .dtrace file.  Nonces associate a procedure exit with a procedure
    entry, and some parts of Daikon's toolset require .dtrace files to
    contain nonces.

---------------------------------

3.1.4 (01 Oct 2004)

Changed the way that output formats are specified to the Daikon,
PrintInvariants, and Annotate tools.  Previously, one supplied
arguments such as --java_output, --jml_output, etc.  Now, one uses
--format NAME, where name is the name of the output format.  The
formats are Daikon, DBC, ESC, IOA, Java, JML, Simplify, and repair.
See the "Invariant syntax" section of the user manual for more
information.  The user manual was also updated with improved
descriptions of the output formats.

LinearBinary invariants are now printed in standard form (ax + by + c = 0)
rather than slope intercept form, (y = ax + b).  They also now have
integer coefficients and like LinearTernary invariants, the
coefficient of the x variable is positive.

Improved portability to Windows systems by changing instances of the
literal "\n" in code to System.getProperty("line.separator"), or using
println().

Removed most calls to System.exit in Daikon.  This makes it easier to call
methods (including main) defined by Daikon programmatically.

The "--no_reflection" and "--max_invariants_pp N" options were
added to Annotate tool.  See the "Annotate tool" section of the
user manual for more information.

The Annotate class was made public so that it could be accessed
programmatically from other Java applications.  State-holding static
variables were removed from Annotate, so that multiple calls of main()
from within another application always yield the same initial Annotate
state.

Support for a number of deprecated optimizations was removed.
The global program point hierarchy optimization, the top-down approach
to optimizing the program point / variable hierarchy, and
linked suppressions were removed along with their corresponding
configuration options.

The Range invariants (EqualMinusOne, EqualOne, EqualZero, GreaterEqual64,
GreaterEqualZero, BooleanVal, Bound0_63, Even, and PowerOfTwo) are now
checked on elements of arrays in addition to scalar variables.
These are not normally visible (since they are implied by the Bound and
OneOf invariants), but are used internally to suppress other invariants.

Added the configuration option daikon.PptRelation.enable_object_user.
See the "List of Configuration Options" section
of the user manual for more information.

The mechanism by which invariants are instantiated was simplified.
See the "New Invariants" section of the developer manual for
more information.

The Kvasir dynamic C front-end has undergone a number of internal
improvements, in preparation for adding support for global variables
and arrays.  The only user-visible changes so far are minor
improvements in finding the names of structure members and the correct
locations of function parameters in some circumstances.

---------------------------------

3.1.3 (01 Sep 2004)

Several bugs in the LinearyTernary invariant were fixed.  Under some
conditions, LinearTernary invariants were missed when initial points
formed a line and not a plane.  Also, the canonical form of the
coefficients were changed to be more readable.

A bug in non-instantiating suppressions was fixed.  The problem
occurred when multiple distinct negative values were used to specify
in the decl file that a variable was comparable to all other variables.

Added configuration options daikon.Daikon.undo_opts and
daikon.Daikon.quiet, See the "List of Configuration Options" section
of the user manual for more information.

---------------------------------

3.1.2 (03 Aug 2004)

The non-instantiating suppression mechanism has been significantly
optimized.  Performance for programs with large number of variables
should be significantly enhanced.  Configuration option
daikon.suppress.NIS.antecedent_method now defaults to true.

The PrintInvariants utility was upgraded to handle InvMap files (the
output from the diff utility) as well PptMap files.  The command
line option --config was added so that PrintInvariants can read files
of configuration options.

The command line option --java_output was added to the Annotate
utility.  See the "Annotate" section of the user manual for more
information.

Added configuration options daikon.FileIO.continue_after_file_exception
and daikon.PrintInvariants.print_all.  See the "List of Configuration
Options" section of the user manual for more information.

Added MemberString invariant (looks for strings that appear in a
sequence of strings) and comparison invariants between two
sequences of strings (SeqSeqStringEqual, SeqSeqStringGreaterThan,
SeqSeqStringGreaterEqual, SeqSeqStringLessThan, and SeqSeqStringLessEqual).

Removed the StringComparison invariant.  This invariant was previously
replaced by the individual invariants StringEqual, StringLessThan,
StringLessEqual, StringGreaterThan, and StringGreaterEqual but still
remained in the documentation and code.

The implementation of SubSequence and SubSequenceFloat invariants has
been changed to create separate invariants for SubSequence and
SuperSequence.  This should have no user visible ramifications except
that the configuration options to enable SuperSequence invariants have
names that are distinct from the SubSequence invariants (SuperSequence,
and SuperSequenceFloat).  See the "List of Configuration Options"
section of the user manual for more information.  These invariants are
also documented in the "Invariant List" section of the user manual.

The internal mechanism for adding invariants has been changed.  The
variable specific factories have been replaced with a single list of
invariants.  See the "New Invariants" section of the developer manual
for more information.

---------------------------------

3.1.1 (01 July 2004)

Modified Java formatting to used FuzzyFloat comparisons rather than
directly comparing floating point numbers.  By default, FuzzyFloat
comparisons are used when generating invariants.  More information on
fuzzy comparisons is available in the 'List of configuration options'
section of the user manual under the configuration option
daikon.inv.Invariant.fuzzy_ratio.

Fixed some minor bugs in the Java formatting that allow them to
compile more cleanly.

Added NonZeroFloat invariant.

The kmeans clustering program now compiles under gcc 3; previously, it only
compiled under gcc 2.  (kmeans can be used to create splitting conditions
via AI clustering; see section 'Cluster analysis for splitters' in the
manual.)

We have moved the Daikon mailing lists (daikon-announce, daikon-discuss,
and daikon-developers) from pag.csail.mit.edu to lists.csail.mit.edu.  Any
changes to your subscription must be made at lists.csail.mit.edu.

---------------------------------

3.1.0 (01 June 2004)

Daikon now includes a new front-end for C programs, named "Kvasir".
Unlike previous C front-ends, which worked by rewriting source code,
Kvasir uses the Valgrind framework and debugging information in the
DWARF-2 format to trace a program's execution given only a binary.
Kvasir is generally easier to use, faster and more robust than the old
C front-end, but it does not yet support all of the features of the
old C front-end, and it can be used only on x86 platforms running
Linux.  More information on Kvasir is in the "Binary C front end
Kvasir" section of the user manual

Several bugs in Daikon's JML output were fixed.  The JML output is now
parsed correctly by both the JML tools and ESC/Java2.  (However, the
"assignable" clause is given a default value; it will be made more accurate
in a future release.)

---------------------------------

3.0.4 (01 May 2004)

Added Annotate as a replacement for MergeEsc.  Annotate inserts
Daikon-generated invariants into Java source files as ESC/JML/DBC
annotations.  See the "Annotate" section of the user manual for more
information.

Added InvariantChecker as a replacement for MakeInvariantChecker.
InvariantChecker checks invariants against data trace files.
InvariantChecker resolves a number of limitations in MakeInvariantChecker.
See the "InvariantChecker" section of the user manual for more information.

The java output format has been significantly enhanced.  See the
--java_output entry in the Daikon "Command line options" section
of the user manual for more information.

Some of the dfej command line options have changed.  See the "dfej options"
section of the user manual for more information.

Added the configuration option daikon.FileIO.unmatched_procedure_entries_quiet
See the "List of Configuration Options" section of the user manual for
more information.

Some bugs were fixed based on user feedback.  Daikon will no longer
terminate with an error if the trace file ends in the middle of the
record.  The last record will simply be ignored.  The dtype-perl script
is now included in the distribution.

---------------------------------

3.0.3 (01 April 2004)

A new optimization was added to Daikon to suppress invariants that
are implied by other invariants.  Suppressed invariants are neither
printed nor written to the invariant output file.  This optimization
reduces memory use and limits the number of redundant invariants that
are printed.  It can be disabled if desired via the
daikon.suppress.NIS.enabled configuration variable.  See the "List of
Configuration Options" section of the user manual for more
information.

Added the TraceSelect program which creates random selection of data
for splitters.  See the "Random selection for splitters" section of
the user manual for more information.

The output that is printed while daikon is running was enhanced to
show the percentage of the trace file that has been processed.  The
configuration variables daikon.FileIO.count_lines and
daikon.FileIO.max_line_number control this feature.  See the "List of
Configuration Options" section of the user manual for more
information.

The manual was updated to explain how to pass environment variables
to an instrumented java program.  See the "dfej options" section
of the user manual for more information.

The manual was updated to explain how to work-around the use of
realloc in C programs.  See the "C program requirements" section
of the user manual for more information.

-----------------

3.0.2 (27 February 2004)

The environment variables DTRACELIMIT and DTRACELIMITTERMINATE were
added to dfej.  These allow the size of the output tracefile to be controlled.
See the "dfej options" section of the user manual for more information.

Fixed some bugs in dfej, dfec, and MergeESC.

The implementation of sequence index comparison invariants has been
changed to create separate invariants for each comparison (Equal,
NonEqual, LessThan etc).  This should have no user visible ramifications
except that the configuration options to enable these invariants have
new names.  See the "List of Configuration Options" section of the user
manual for more information.  These invariants are also documented in
the "Invariant List" section of the user manual.

The user manual has been updated.  The "C examples" section has been
improved; a subsection on "Dealing with large examples" has been added.
The "C program requirements" and "No return from procedure" sections
were also updated.

The developer manual has been updated with a new "Unit Testing" section.

-----------------

3.0.1 (02 February 2004)

Three new binary invariants were added to Daikon: square, bitwise subset,
and divides without remainder.  Each of these is checked both between
scalar variables and also between the corresponding elements of a
sequence.  For more information, see the "Invariant List" section of the
user manual.

The configuration variable for enabling the BitwiseComplement invariant is
now a member of the type specific Numeric class rather than of the type
specific FunctionUnary class.  See the "Configuration options" section of
the user manual for details.

The configuration variable daikon.Daikon.use_suppression_optimization
(default true) was added.  This controls whether or not invariants that are
implied by other invariants are suppressed.  See the "Configuration
options" section of the user manual for details.

The command line option '--omit_from_output [0rs]' was added to Daikon.
This option controls what invariants are written to the output invariant
file.  It is possible to remove program points that are not referenced in
the trace file, reflexive invariants, and invariants that are suppressed.
See the "Command line options" section of the manual for more information.

-----------------

3.0.0 (19 December 2003)

Daikon version 3 is now the standard distribution.

Daikon version 2 reads an entire data trace file into memory and then
processes it in multiple passes.  By contrast, Daikon version 3
processes samples incrementally in a single pass, without needing to
store the entire trace file in memory.  This allows version 3 to
handle data trace files of essentially unlimited size.  There are a
number of other differences between version 2 and version 3.  The most
important are summarized below.

  - A number of command line options have changed.  The options
    noInvariantGuarding and suppressSplitterErrors are now
    configuration variable.  The options suppress_cont,
    no_suppress_cont, and suppress_post have been removed.  The option
    prob_limit has been replaced by the similar option conf_limit.
    The track option was added for debugging specific invariants.

  - There are many new configuration variables.  For details, see the
    "Configuration options" section of the manual.

  - You may get slightly different output from that of version 2.  The
    two versions test the same invariants, but the two versions use
    different optimizations, and the mechanism for calculating the
    statistical confidence level of each invariant has changed.  As a
    result, which invariants are printed can differ between the two
    versions.  For example, version 3 prints some redundant invariants
    that are not printed in version 2.  These changes are mainly
    minor; they do not affect output correctness, only verbosity; and
    they will become less as more optimizations are added to version
    3.

New command-line options have been added to the LogicalCompare
program.  See the manual for details.

The developers manual has been significantly rewritten for clarity and
some sections have been added.

-----------------

2.5.3 (01 October 2003)

The default VarComparability has been changed from none to implicit.
Decls file may need to be changed to specify the comparability as
'none' at the top of the file if implicit is not the appropriate
default.

Some minor changes were made to the user and developer manuals to
enhance clarity.

A number of bugs were fixed, particularly in Daikon version 3 (experimental).

-----------------

2.5.2 (03 September 2003)

Fixed some Simplify formatting bugs.

Fixed some dfej bugs.

The implementation of SubSet and SuperSet invariants has been changed
to create separate invariants for SubSet and SuperSet.  This should
have no user visible ramifications except that the configuration
options to enable SuperSet invariants have names which are distinct
from the SubSet invariants (SuperSet, and SuperSetFloat).  See the
"List of Configuration Options" section of the user manual for more
information.  These invariants are also documented in the "Invariant
List" section of the user manual.

-----------------

2.5.1 (01 August 2003)

Added the LogicalCompare program which compares two sets of invariants
describing a software module and determines if one set of the
invariants implies the other.  See the "LogicalCompare" section of the
user manual for more information.

Added the daikon command line option --disc_reason that will indicate
the reason a specified invariant was not printed.  See the "Command
line options for Daikon" section of the user manual for more
information

Added configuration options daikon.simplify.Session.trace_input, and
daikon.simplify.LemmaStack.synchronous_errors to provide additional
information when debugging Simplify problems.  See the "List of
Configuration Options" section of the user manual for more
information.

Both the user manual and developer manual have been significantly
enhanced.  The sections concerning the C and Java front ends in the
user manual have had significant troubleshooting information added.
The dfec (C front end) section also makes more clear that dfec only
supports programs that are BOTH legal ANSI/ISO C programs and legal
C++ programs.

The implementation of Sequence-Scalar, Sequence-Sequence and Pairwise
comparisons has been changed to create separate invariants for each
possible comparison (<, <=, ==, >=, >).  This should have no user
visible ramifications except that the configuration options to disable
comparisons have individual names (e.g., SeqFloatEqual,
SeqFloatGreaterEqual, etc).  See the "List of Configuration Options"
section of the user manual for more information.  These invariants are
also documented in the "Invariant List" section of the user manual.

-----------------

2.5.0 (01 July 2003)

Daikon now requires JDK 1.4.  If you are still using JDK 1.3, you will
need to upgrade in order to run Daikon.

Added a developer manual (developer.html, developer.info,
developer.pdf, etc) to the doc directory.  The developer manual
indicates how to extend Daikon with new invariants, new derived
variables, and front ends for new languages.  It also contains
information about implementation and debugging.  The user manual has
been simplified by moving appropriate sections to the developer
manual.

Added the MakeInvariantChecker program (in V3 only) which can take a set
of invariants found by Daikon and create a specialized checking
program that checks only those invariants.  See the "Invariant
Checker" section of the manual for more information.

----------------

2.4.9 (02 June 2003)

Changed the default for Simplify iterations from 1000000 to 1000.
This should provide reasonable results while being less
likely to take an inordinate amount of time.  Also added the
configuration options daikon.simplify.Session.simplify_timeout and
daikon.simplify.Session.verbose_progress.  See the "List of
Configuration Options" section of the manual for more information.

Added new command line options for daikon.pl (--instrument, --nogui,
--src, and --debug).  See the "Command line options for daikon.pl"
section of the manual for more information.

----------------

2.4.8 (13 May 2003)

The internal mechanism for formatting output has been enhanced.  There
is now a single routine (format_using (OutputFormat)) that replaces
the previous output specific format routines.  See the "New formatting
for invariants" section of the manual for more information on adding
new formatting routines.

Added the capability to use a decls file to the convertcsv.pl script.
See the usage message of convertcsv.pl for more information.

----------------

2.4.7 (30 April 2003):

The perl front end (dfepl) has been significantly enhanced.  An
additional Perl example has been added.  See the "Perl examples" and
"Instrumenting Perl programs" sections of the manual for more
information.

The manual has been reformatted and edited in a number of areas to improve
clarity and readability.

----------------

2.4.6 (24 April 2003):

Floating-point quantities can be considered equal even if they differ
slightly (say, due to floating-point roundoff).  Configuration option
daikon.inv.Invariant.fuzzy_ratio sets the ratio by which floating-point
numbers may differ and still be considered equal; a value of 0 disables
these approximate comparisons.

A new front end for csv (comma-separated-value) files is provided; run
program convertcsv.pl, which appears in the bin/ directory.

The manual now contains a list of all invariants that Daikon detects, with
a short description of each.  Recall that users can add their own
(possibly domain-specific) invariants.

Other parts of the manual have been enhanced, such as descriptions of
variable names and dealing with too-large datasets.

----------------

2.4.5 (1 April 2003):

"Dummy invariants" permit properties that are not in Daikon's grammar to be
output, when they appear as splitting conditions.  It is possible to
specify in the splitter info file how to format such properties in each of
the output formats that Daikon supports.

The manual describes how to deal with contradictory invariants, which
Daikon might sometimes produce due to a bug or a limitation.

----------------

2.4.4 (2 March 2003):

dfec now works with gcc 2.96 (the version that is distributed with Red Hat
Linux, but which is not an official gcc release).

The Context GUI bug that caused it to sometimes print question marks in
invariants is fixed.

----------------

2.4.3 (1 February 2003):

dfej now produces output with program points named in Java, not JVML
format:  "foo(int, java.lang.String[])", not "foo(I[Ljava/lang/String;)".

----------------

2.4.2 (20 January 2003):

Fix several bugs, mostly reported by Tao Xie.

----------------

2.4.1 (1 January 2003):

There are two improvements to running Daikon under Windows.  First, Cygwin
is no longer necessary to run Daikon:  the daikonenv.bat file sets up the
Windows environment to permit Daikon to be run without Cygwin.  Second,
when running under Cygwin, the cygwin-runner.pl script smooths over
differences in path conventions between Cygwin and Windows.

----------------

2.4.0 (1 December 2002):

Daikon can detect invariants in Perl programs.  See the "Perl examples" and
"Instrumenting Perl programs" sections of the manual.

Three new mailing lists have been set up:
  daikon-announce@lists.csail.mit.edu
  daikon-discuss@lists.csail.mit.edu
  daikon-developers@lists.csail.mit.edu
To subscribe, visit http://lists.csail.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo.

The Context GUI now shares the same look and feel as the Tree GUI.
Furthermore, .dci files are no longer necessary for the Context GUI, and
its setup has been somewhat simplified.

The --no_suppress_cont option to Daikon and to PrintInvariants displays
invariants even if they are implied by controlling program points.

The -y option to Diff includes (statistically) unjustified invariants.

To customize the behavior of the C runtime system (for instance, to produce
gzipped .dtrace files or to customize the runtime's behavior when it
detects a memory error in your program), edit file
$DAIKONDIR/front-end/c/daikon_runtime.h.

The manual sections on dealing with variable comparability, large .dtrace
files, and memory exhaustion have been revised and expanded.

----------------

2.3.18 (2 November 2002):

Improved directions for building dfec (if you have a license to the EDG
C/C++ front end).  dfec has also been updated to use EDG 3.0 instead of EDG
2.45.  dfec is substantially more robust; most C programs and many C++
programs should be instrumented without difficulty.

Fixed a small problem in the example sections of the manual.

Explained a JTB ParseException error and how to work around it.

----------------

2.3.17 (9 October 2002):

Version numbers were wrong in last release; re-release to fix the problem.

Manual improvements:  note that local variables are not examined; that
Daikon can work over data that comes from sources other than program
executions; that all exit points must have the same number of variables;
that "nonsensical" is permitted as a value in a .dtrace file.

----------------

2.3.16 (1 October 2002):

Bugfix release.

----------------

2.3.15 (12 September 2002):

Discontinued the compiled distribution; now there is only one Daikon
distribution, the source distribution, which includes both pre-compiled
files and source files.

Added top-level Makefile, which simplifies Daikon installation.

dfec enhancements:
  added --flatten-mdas option
  improved documentation of disambiguation file

----------------

2.3.14 (1 August 2002):

CreateSpinfoC program creates splitting conditions via static analysis of C
programs; this complements CreateSpinfo, which works for Java programs.

daikon_runtime.h lists many customization variables for the Daikon C
Runtime.

----------------

2.3.13 (17 July 2002):

Fix bug when running from daikon.jar.

Improvements to detection of floating-point invariants.

Manual gives example of use of orig variables, explains what to do when
Daikon runs slowly, discusses Ajax "too many levels of symbolic links"
error.

----------------

2.3.12 (11 July 2002):

Daikon reports invariants over floating-point numbers.  Previously, it
silently ignored floating-point numbers.

----------------

2.3.11 (9 July 2002):

The runcluster.pl program performs cluster analysis (a machine learning
technique) to produce splitter info files.  This is in addition to other
ways of producing splitter info files, such as static analysis or writing
them by hand.

The .decls file format now supports auxiliary information for declared
types.  It can indicate that a collection never contains duplicates or that
order does not matter (both useful for avoiding obvious invariants over
sets), properties of null in a collection, and whether a variable is a
call-by-value parameter (and so can never change, from the point of view of
the caller).  Use of this information reduces Daikon's output.

The manual emphasizes that dfec only works on ANSI/ISO C programs (that are
also legal C++ programs), and gives a number of hints for making your C
programs compliant.

----------------

2.3.10 (10 June 2002):

Bugfix release.

----------------

2.3.9 (4 June 2002):

Improve dfec documentation: explain more error messages (including array
bounds errors), add gcc installation instructions, explain uninitialized
array element processing.

----------------

2.3.8 (10 May 2002):

This release coordinates with a new release of the dfec binaries (at
http://pag.csail.mit.edu/daikon/download/).

Remove some innocuous syntax anachronisms from example C programs.
Add the example C programs to the distribution.
Add manual section describing the example C programs.
Improve dfec documentation in the manual.
The Context GUI now supports C programs.

Rearrange distribution to avoid very long file names in tar file.

----------------

2.3.7 (1 May 2002):

Rewrite of dfec documentation.  dfec is now easier to use, more robust, and
supports new options, such as struct instrumentation depth.

Remove incorrect dfej documentation for "-instrsourcedir=.".

Add documentation for CreateSpinfo program.

Add new configuration options daikon.split.FileCompiler.compiler and
daikon.split.TimedProcess.compile_wait.

----------------

2.3.6 (5 April 2002):

MergeESC tool inserts Daikon output into Java source files as ESC/Java
comments.

Invariant Diff can compute set difference, union, and xor.  It can produce
output in the new InvMap format, and can read that format.  New flags
enable specification of custom comparators.

dfej's "-daikon-omit" flag can be a regular expression.

Daikon takes a --config_option flag to specify configuration settings.

Ajax tool bug fixes.

Improved installation and troubleshooting instructions.

----------------

2.3.5 (1 March 2002):

Add --files_from command-line argument to Daikon.

Add -a and -l command-line arguments to Diff.

----------------

2.3.4 (17 February 2002):

Add four new programs to the distribution:
  createspinfo.pl trace-untruncate trace-purge-fns.pl trace-purge-vars.pl

Manual enhancements:
 * Add section on configuration options.
 * Add paragraph about debugging options.
 * Add text about two new GUI filters.
 * Typo fixes.

----------------

2.3.3 (11 February 2002):

Add new flags to Diff program.

Manual enhancements:
 * Fix errors with "-noajax" flag in manual.
 * Describe redundant invariants and how to print them.
 * Explain format of Java program point names.
 * Explain more invariant (Daikon output) syntax.
 * Discuss dealing with errors in the external Ajax and Simplify programs.

----------------

2.3.2 (7 December 2001):

Support for splitter files that specify conditions to use when detecting
implications (conditional invariants).

Daikon's --config option permits reading and saving sets of configuration
options.

The Daikon Java runtime respects the DTRACEAPPEND environment variable.

dfec requires that gcc be present.

----------------

2.3.1 (8 October 2001):

Added Context GUI, which shows relevant invariants in a separate window as
you browse code in a text editor.

Added many index entries to manual.

----------------

2.3.0 (11 September 2001):

Added linear ternary invariants, of the form z = ax + by + c.
