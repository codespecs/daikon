<h2><a name="How_can_I_get_Daikon">How can I get Daikon?</a></h2>

<p>
Daikon is available for download, including source code, binaries, and
documentation, at <a href="http://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/download/">http://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/download/</a>.
</p>


<h2><a name="What_is_Daikon">What is Daikon?</a></h2>

<p>
Daikon is an <em>invariant detector</em>.  Given a data source (such as the
values computed by a program at run time), Daikon generalizes over the
observed values and reports properties that are true about the data.
Daikon implements a type of machine learning to summarize the raw data into
a small set of easily comprehensible formulas.
</p>


<h2><a name="What_is_an_operational_abstraction">What is an operational abstraction?</a></h2>

<p>
The set of formulas that Daikon outputs is called an <em>operational
abstraction</em>.  The operational abstraction states properties about a
program's data structures &mdash; the sort that might be written in an
<code>assert</code> statement or a formal specification.
</p>

<p>
Here is a simple example of Daikon's output:  <a
href="StackAr.html">StackAr.html</a>.  The colored annotations starting
with &ldquo;<code style="color:red;">@</code>&rdquo; (in <a
href="https://www.cs.ucf.edu/~leavens/JML/">JML</a> format)
were automatically detected by
Daikon and automatically inserted in the source code.  Many other uses for
invariants are possible in addition to insertion as documentation.
</p>


<h2><a name="What_is_an_operational_abstraction_good_for">What is an operational abstraction good for?</a></h2>

<p>
Program properties (such as specifications and dynamically detected
invariants) are useful for a wide variety of software construction,
understanding, reuse, and modification tasks.  The properties may be
examined by a human or used as input to a tool
</p>

<p>
Direct uses of invariants by a human include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Document code, indicating the structure of its data and computation.</li>
  <li>Maintain invariants to avoid introducing bugs; if a property is
      established at one point in a program, it is likely to be depended on
      elsewhere, but if the invariant is not documented, it is all to easy
      to accidentally violate it, introducing a bug in a far-removed part
      of the program.</li>
  <li>Locate unusual conditions that should be brought to a programmer's
      attention and may be bugs.</li>
  <li>Bootstrap proofs and aid static checkers by providing goals and
      automating the time-consuming, tedious chore of annotating programs.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Uses of invariants by other tools include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Check assumptions by converting the invariants to <code>assert</code>
      statements.</li>
  <li>Validate test suites by indicating the level of value coverage, which
      indicates how many different values are computed.  This complements
      code coverage, which tells how many lines are executed.</li>
  <li>Provide hints for profile-directed compilation, but at the level of
      the program abstractions, permitting entire function calls to
      possibly be omitted after a check.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="How_is_an_operational_abstraction_used">How is an operational abstraction used?</a></h2>

<p>
An operational abstraction can be used automatically, in which case a human
never directly examines it, or both automatically and manually, in which
case a human does examine (parts of) it.  A number of automatic uses are
discussed in the <a href="pubs/">research papers</a> that use Daikon.
</p>

<p>
As an example of manual use of Daikon, a programmer might run it on a
program and see, at a procedure entry,
</p>
<pre>
  w >= 0
  x &lt; 10
  y = w + x
  z = 0 (mod 4)
</pre>
<p>
(These examples are all numeric for simplicity, but Daikon detects
relationships over general data structures, including arrays, collections,
and pointers.)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Seeing the &ldquo;w >= 0&rdquo; invariant, the programmer might remark, &ldquo;I already knew
that w is non-negative; that doesn't help me.&rdquo;  (However, examining
this invariant consumes little of the programmer's time.)
</li>
<li>
Seeing the &ldquo;x &lt; 10&rdquo; invariant, the programmer might realize after a
moment's thought that the test suite is deficient:  it never manipulates
data structures containing more than 9 elements.  This invariant has
indicated not only a problem with the test suite, but exactly how to fix
it.
</li>
<li>
Seeing the &ldquo;y = w + x&rdquo; invariant, the programmer might suddenly understand
the operation of the algorithm or why certain parts of the program are
coded in the way they are.  This can prevent long sessions of puzzlement
over the system, and inserting the invariant as a comment can prevent
others from going through the same confusion.
</li>
<li>
Seeing the &ldquo;z = 0 (mod 4)&rdquo; invariant, the programmer might be confused
about why z is always a multiple of 4.  The programmer has two options.
<ol>
  <li>
The programmer can examine the program and test
   suite to understand why this is so.  (Perhaps z holds a pointer value or
   is some other kind of specialized index; perhaps it is a capacity that
   is always increased by a multiple of 4; perhaps there is some odd
   property of the test suite.)  This gives the programmer a much better
   understanding of the operation of the program.
  </li>
  <li>
The other option is for the programmer not to investigate this property
   further &mdash; perhaps it is not directly relevant to the current task &mdash;
   but to be careful not to make changes that violate that property.
   Violating the property could introduce errors if other parts of the code
   depend on it.
  </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="How_accurate_is_Daikon">How accurate is Daikon?</a></h2>

<p>
The Daikon system examines the values computed during the target program's
execution, looking for patterns and relationships among those values.
There are two potential problems:  missing properties (false negatives),
and spurious properties (false positives).
</p>

<p>
False negatives are inevitable, because every tool has a grammar that
limits what it can express.  Daikon has a relatively simple and broadly
applicable grammar.  Users can extend it easily, by writing a Java class
that satisfies an interface with four methods.
</p>

<p>
False positives can also occur; the properties are not guaranteed to hold
for every possible execution.  As with any other dynamic (run-time)
technique, such as testing, the results depend on the quality of the test
suite.  In practice, the results have proved to be quite accurate even with
very modest test suites, thanks to statistical tests that weed out most
false positives.  And research has shown that the inaccuracies can help in
improving test suites.
</p>


<h2><a name="How_can_I_change_my_program...">How can I change my program to make Daikon work better?</a></h2>

<p>
Another way of stating this question is, &ldquo;On what sort of programs does
Daikon tend to perform poorly?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Typically, users will not run Daikon on a whole program, but on the particular
component(s) of interest.  Trying to run Daikon on too much data will
overwhelm either Daikon, or else you when you try to examine the output.
(If you plan to feed the output into another tool, verbosity is less of a
concern.)
</p>

<p>
Daikon can produce invariants if you provide it with the appropriate
values.  If your data structures are organized in a fashion that makes
Daikon unable to access those values, then Daikon obviously cannot produce
any desired output.
If values are packed (for instance, using a bit array instead of an array
of boolean values), then Daikon will not be able to access the values.
If values have very complex names (for example, <code>a.b[i].c.d()</code>, then
Daikon may not even try that variable name.  See the configuration options
that control what derived variables Daikon uses.
</p>


<h2><a name="What_does_the_name_Daikon_mean">What does the name Daikon mean?</a></h2>

<p>
A daikon is a type of Asian radish.  Daikon is pronounced like the two
English words die-con.  The name can be thought of as standing for &ldquo;dynamic
conjectures&rdquo;.
</p>


<h2><a name="Whats_new">What's new in Daikon?</a></h2>

<p>
The <a href="download/doc/CHANGELOG.md">CHANGELOG.md file</a> lists what is new in
each release of Daikon.
</p>

<p>
Before you
report a bug, please
upgrade to the latest version of Daikon to verify that the problem still
exists, and then include all the <a
href="download/doc/daikon.html#Reporting-problems">information</a> requested by
the manual.
</p>


<h2><a name="How_can_I_get_help">How can I get help?  How can I learn more?</a></h2>

<p>
If you have questions about using Daikon, first read the
<a href="download/doc/daikon.html">Daikon manual</a>, including the
<a href="download/doc/daikon.html#Troubleshooting">&ldquo;Troubleshooting&rdquo; section</a>.
If you have questions about modifying Daikon, also see the
<a href="download/doc/developer.html">Daikon developer manual</a>, the
<a href="download/api/">Javadoc API documentation</a>, and the
source code.
</p>

<p>
If you do not find an answer in the documentation, or you think you have
found an error (bug), then use one of the
<a href="mailing-lists.html">mailing lists</a> to get help from other
Daikon users and from the Daikon developers.  The manual tells you
what <a href="download/doc/daikon.html#Reporting-problems">information to include</a> in
your bug report in order to make it most useful, which maximizes your
chances of receiving a fast and relevant reply.
</p>
