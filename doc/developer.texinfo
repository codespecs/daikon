@section Compiling Daikon

@cindex compiling Daikon

To compile Daikon, type @command{make} in @file{$DAIKONDIR/java/} or any of its
subdirectories.  Alternately, type @command{make -C $DAIKONDIR compile}.
To create the @file{daikon.jar} file, type @command{make -C $DAIKONDIR daikon.jar}.

The distribution includes @file{daikon.jar} and compiled @file{.class} files,
so you do not need to compile them yourself unless you make changes.

For more information about compiling Daikon, see the comments in the Makefiles.

When you compile Daikon, environment variables @env{DAIKONDIR}
and @env{JAVA_HOME} must be set.
See the installation instructions
(@ref{Installing Daikon,,,daikon,Daikon User Manual}) for details.
Thus, a complete @file{.bashrc} or @file{.bash_profile} shell setup file
(for Fedora or Ubuntu)
that would enable you to compile Daikon might look like the following:

@example
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java

export DAIKONDIR=$HOME/daikon
source $DAIKONDIR/scripts/daikon.bashrc
@end example
@c Previously contained the following, but why?  Setting classpath globally
@c is bad style.
@c export CLASSPATH=.:$CLASSPATH


@cindex .jpp files
@cindex jpp files

When setting up environment pathname variables under Windows/Cygwin
(such as @command{JAVA_HOME}) make sure that the
pathname is specified in Linux format (e.g., @file{/cygdrive/c/daikon}
rather than @file{C:\daikon}).  However, the
@env{CLASSPATH} environment variable is a special case;
as @command{java} is a Windows
program, it expects @env{CLASSPATH} to be in Windows format.
This is the only exception to Cygwin looking like Linux.
Thus @env{CLASSPATH} must
always be in Windows format; i.e., it should use semicolons (;) rather
than colons (:) as a path separator.
Using the wrong filename format or the wrong pathname separator
is a common source of errors that will result in odd error
messages and build failures.

Please note this applies to a @command{-CLASSPATH} argument to
@command{java} as well: it must have Windows pathnames.
One easy way to deal with this is to use the @command{cygpath} utility:
@example
java -cp "`cygpath -wp linux/path/a:linux/path/b`" <other arguments>
@end example
@noindent
Note both the back quotes (@samp{`}) to force @command{cygpath} to be evaluated
before calling @command{java} and the double quotes (@samp{"}) to protect against
special characters and spaces in Windows paths.

@subsection Requirements for compiling Daikon

The list at the end of this section identifies the software you will
need to have on your path.

To install all these dependencies under Ubuntu, run the command:
@exampleindent 2
@example
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk gcc ctags graphviz netpbm texlive texinfo
@end example
@exampleindent 5
Similar commands would be used with other package management systems
on other operating systems.

@cindex Windows, compiling
To compile Daikon on Windows, the best approach is to first install the Cygwin
toolset (available at @uref{http://cygwin.com/}), which
contains everything you need to compile and run Linux programs under
Windows.  You can install Cygwin by running one of the setup
programs (based on your machine type) found
at @uref{http://cygwin.com/install.html}.
Then, install any necessary programs such as those below.

@itemize @bullet

@item
a Java compiler such as @samp{javac}.  This is needed because Daikon is
written in Java.
@cindex @samp{javac} compiler, overriding
@cindex Java compiler, specifying
To override the default Java compiler (@samp{javac}), create a
@file{Makefile.user} file in the @file{daikon} (@env{$DAIKONDIR}) directory and add a line
like the following.
@example
JAVAC ?= jikes -g +E +F
@end example

@item
the C preprocessor
@command{cpp}.  This is needed to convert each @file{.jpp} file in the
distribution into multiple @file{.java} files, which are then compiled.
If you have a C compiler, you almost certainly have @command{cpp}.
If you do not have @command{cpp} (or @command{gcc}, which can emulate
@command{cpp} via @command{gcc -E}), you may run
@command{make -C $DAIKONDIR/java avoid-jpp}, in
which case changes to @code{.jpp} files will not be reflected in the
@file{.java} files or the compiled @file{.class} files.  (The purpose
of the @file{.jpp} files is to avoid code duplication by placing
common code in a single file, then generating other files that need to
include that common code.)

@item
@c needs version 4.7 or newer; version 4.7 was released in April 2004
@command{makeinfo}.
This is needed to make the documentation (via @command{make -C $DAIKONDIR/doc}).

@item
@command{dos2unix} or @command{perl}.
This is used to ensure that the output is the same under Unix and Windows.

@node    Requirements for compiling Kvasir
@subsection Requirements for compiling Kvasir

In order to compile Kvasir, the Daikon front end for the C language
(@pxref{Kvasir,,,daikon,Daikon User Manual}), you will need some
additional tools beyond those required to compile Daikon.

To install these dependencies under Ubuntu, run the command:
@exampleindent 2
@example
sudo apt-get install m4 automake autoconf binutils-dev

@node    Using Eclipse
@section Using Eclipse

@cindex Eclipse

[To be improved.]

Here is one way to use Eclipse to edit Daikon.

First, make sure that Daikon builds cleanly from the command line.

File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace

Choose the @file{java} directory of your Daikon checkout

Project > properties > Java build path:
 libraries : @command{add external jars} everything in the lib/ directory,
   plus also the @file{tools.jar} file in the @file{lib/} directory of your JDK.
   (I'm not sure why, but @command{add jars} doesn't show all @file{.jar}
   files in the directory.)

 Source:
   add @file{Daikon}, remove @file{Daikon/src}.
   Default output folder: change from @file{Daikon/bin} to @file{Daikon}.


@node    New invariants
@section New invariants

@cindex new invariants
@cindex adding new invariants

You can easily write your own invariants and have Daikon check them,
in addition to all the other invariants that are already part of Daikon.
Adding a new invariant to Daikon requires writing one Java class, as
explained below.
@itemize
@item
If you are willing to edit the Daikon source code, you should define the
invariant in Daikon's source code, in a subdirectory of
@file{java/daikon/inv/}.  Then, edit method @code{Daikon.setup_proto_invs} to
call the new invariant's @code{get_proto} method and recompile Daikon.
@item
If you do not wish to edit the Daikon source code, then compile the new
invariant and put its @file{.class} file on your classpath.  Then, invoke
Daikon with the @option{--user_defined_invariant} command-line argument
(@pxref{Options to control invariant detection,,,daikon,Daikon User Manual}).
@end itemize



The file @file{java/daikon/inv/unary/scalar/Positive.java} in the
Daikon distribution contains a sample invariant.  This invariant is
true if the variable is always positive (greater than zero).  This
invariant is subsumed by other invariants in the system; it is provided
only as a pedagogical example.  To enable the invariant, comment out the
appropriate line in @code{Daikon.setup_proto_invs()}, then recompile
Daikon.


A Java class defining an invariant is a concrete subclass of one of the direct subclasses of
@uref{http://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/download/api/daikon/inv/unary/UnaryInvariant.html,@code{UnaryInvariant}},
@uref{http://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/download/api/daikon/inv/binary/BinaryInvariant.html,@code{BinaryInvariant}},
or
@uref{http://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/download/api/daikon/inv/ternary/TernaryInvariant.html,@code{TernaryInvariant}}.
A complete list of invariants appears in the body of
@code{Daikon.setup_proto_invs()}.

Daikon's invariants are first instantiated, then are presented samples
(tuples of values for all the variables of interest to the invariant;
this might be a 1-tuple, a 2-tuple, or a 3-tuple) in turn.  If any
sample falsifies the invariant, the invariant destroys itself.  All
remaining invariants at the end of the program run can be queried for
their statistical confidence, then reported as
likely to be true.

You need to implement the abstract methods of @uref{http://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/download/api/daikon/inv/Invariant.html,@code{Invariant}} that are not defined in one of the subclasses listed above.  You also need to define a constructor and a static method:

@table @code
@item protected @var{InvName}(PptSlice ppt)
Constructor for class @var{InvName}.  Should only be called from
@code{instantiate_dyn}.
Its typical implementation is
@example
super(ppt);
@end example

@item public static @var{InvName} get_proto()
Returns the prototype invariant used to create other invariants.  Its
typical implementation is
@example
if (proto == null)
  proto = new InvName(null);
return (proto);
@end example

@end table

Methods that need to be overridden that are defined in a subclass of
@samp{Invariant} include:

@table @code
@item public InvariantStatus check_modified(..., int count)
@itemx public InvariantStatus add_modified(..., int count)
Determines whether the invariant is true for a sample (a tuple of values).
@end table


You will eventually want to override one or more of these methods (@pxref{New formatting for invariants}):

@table @code
@item public String format()
@itemx public String repr()
@itemx public String format_using(OutputFormat format)
Returns a high-level printed representation of the
invariant, for user output.
@end table


@node    New derived variables
@section New derived variables

@cindex derived variable
@cindex variable, derived
@cindex adding new derived variables
@cindex new derived variables

A derived variable is an expression that does not appear in the source
code as a variable, but that Daikon treats as a variable for purposes
of invariant detection.  For instance, if there exists an array
@samp{a} and an integer @samp{i}, then Daikon introduces the derived
variable @samp{a[i]}.  This permits detection of invariants over this
quantity.

(Describing how to create new variety of derived variable is still to
be written.  For now, see the derived variables that appear in the Java
files in directory @file{$DAIKONDIR/java/daikon/derive/}.)


@node    New formatting for invariants
@section New formatting for invariants

@cindex output format, defining new
@cindex new output formats
@cindex adding new output formats

Daikon can print invariants in multiple formats
(@pxref{Invariant syntax,,,daikon,Daikon User Manual}).

To support a new output format, you need to do two things:
@itemize @bullet
@item
In @code{daikon.inv.Invariant.OutputFormat}, add a new static final
field and also update the @code{get} method.
@c (if it returns null, then you
@c will get an @samp{Unknown output format} error message when you run Daikon.)
@item
In every subclass of @code{Invariant}, edit the
@code{format_using} method to handle the new @code{OutputFormat}.
@end itemize

@node    New front ends
@section New front ends

@cindex front end, writing

A front end for Daikon converts data into a form Daikon can process,
producing files in Daikon's input format --- data trace declarations and
records.  For more information about these files, see @ref{File formats}.

The data traces can be obtained from any source.  For instance, front
ends have been built for stock data, weather forecasts, truck weight
data, and spreadsheet data (@pxref{convertcsv.pl,,,daikon,Daikon User
Manual}), among others.  More often, users apply a programming language
front end (also called an @dfn{instrumenter}) to a program, causing
executions of the program to write files in Daikon's format.  (For
information about existing front ends, see
@ref{Front ends (instrumentation),,,daikon,Daikon User Manual}.)
When a general front end is not
available, it is possible to manually instrument a specific program so
that it writes files in Daikon's format.  The resulting instrumented
program is very similar to what an instrumenter would have created, so
this section is relevant to both approaches.

Conceptually, instrumentation is very simple.  For each program point
(say, a line of code or the entry or exit from a procedure) at which you
wish to detect invariants, the front end must arrange to create a
declaration (@pxref{Declarations}) that
lists the variables in scope at that program point, and the front end
must arrange that execution creates a data trace record (@pxref{Data
trace records}) for each execution of that
program point.  Conventionally, the way to create a data trace record is
to insert a @code{printf} (or similar) statement that outputs the current
values of the variables of interest.

@subsection Example instrumented Java program

@cindex instrumenting Java programs
@cindex Java programs, instrumenting

This section gives an example of how an instrumenter for Java might
work; other languages are analogous.
Suppose we wish to instrument file @file{Example.java}.
@example
class Example @{
  // Return either the square of x or the square of (x+1).
  int squar(int x, boolean b) @{
    if (b)
      x++;
    return x*x;
  @}

@noindent
The @file{.decls} file might look like the following.
@example
DECLARE
Example.squar:::ENTER
x
int
int
1
b
boolean
int
2

DECLARE
Example.squar:::EXIT
x
int
int
1
b
boolean
int
2
return
int
int
1
@end example

@noindent
The instrumented @file{.java} file might look like the following.
This example does not compute the ``modified bits'', but simply sets
them all to 1, which is a safe default.
@example
class Example @{
  static @{
    daikon.Runtime.setDtraceMaybe("daikon-output/StackAr.dtrace");
  @}

  // Return either the square of x or the square of (x+1).
  int squar(int x, boolean b) @{
    synchronized (daikon.Runtime.dtrace) @{
      daikon.Runtime.dtrace.println();
      daikon.Runtime.dtrace.println("Example.squar:::ENTER");
      daikon.Runtime.dtrace.println("x");
      daikon.Runtime.dtrace.println(x);
      daikon.Runtime.dtrace.println(1);  // modified bit
      daikon.Runtime.dtrace.println("b");
      daikon.Runtime.dtrace.println(b ? 1 : 0);
      daikon.Runtime.dtrace.println(1);  // modified bit
    @}

    if (b)
      x++;

    int daikon_return_value = x*x;
    synchronized (daikon.Runtime.dtrace) @{
      daikon.Runtime.dtrace.println();
      daikon.Runtime.dtrace.println("Example.squar:::EXIT");
      daikon.Runtime.dtrace.println("x");
      daikon.Runtime.dtrace.println(x);
      daikon.Runtime.dtrace.println(1);  // modified bit
      daikon.Runtime.dtrace.println("b");
      daikon.Runtime.dtrace.println(b ? 1 : 0);
      daikon.Runtime.dtrace.println(1);  // modified bit
      daikon.Runtime.dtrace.println("return");
      daikon.Runtime.dtrace.println(daikon_return_value);
      daikon.Runtime.dtrace.println(1);  // modified bit
    @}

    return daikon_return_value;
  @}
@}
@end example

@noindent
(Daikon's Java front end, Chicory, does not actually insert
instrumentation into the Java source code of your program.  Rather, it
instruments the bytecode as it is loaded into the JVM.  This is more
efficient, and it avoids making any changes to your @file{.java} or
@file{.class} files.  We have shown an example of  Java source code
instrumentation because that is  simpler to explain and understand than
the bytecode instrumentation.)


@node       Instrumenting C programs
@subsection Instrumenting C programs

@cindex C programs, instrumenting
@cindex instrumenting C programs

Daikon comes with a front end for the C language:  Kvasir
(@pxref{Kvasir,,,daikon,Daikon User Manual}).
Kvasir only works under the Linux operating system, and it works only on
``x86'' (Intel 386, 486, 586, 686 compatible) and ``x86-64'' (AMD64, EM64T
compatible) processors.

You may wish to infer invariants over C programs running on other
platforms; for instance, you want a robust C front end that works under
Microsoft Windows.  This section will help you to either write such a
front end or to hand-instrument your program to produce output that
Daikon can process.

We welcome additions and corrections to this part of the manual.  And,
if you write a C instrumenter that might be of use to others, please
contribute it back to the Daikon project.


A front end for C (or any other language) performs two tasks.  It
determines the names of all variables that are in scope at a particular
program point, and it prints the values of those variables each time the
program point executes.

Determining the names of the variables is straightforward.  It requires
either parsing source code or parsing a compiled executable.  In the
latter case, the variables can be determined from debugging information
that the compiler places in the executable.

The challenge for C programs is determining the values of variables at
execution time:  for each variable, the front end must determine whether
the variable's value is valid, and how big the value is.

@cindex valid values
@cindex invalid values
@cindex nonsensical values
@cindex uninitialized variables
@cindex deallocated pointers

A front end should print only variables that have @emph{valid} values.
Examples of invalid values are variables that have not yet been
initialized and pointers whose content has been deallocated.  (A pointer
dereference, such as @samp{*p} or @samp{p->field}, can itself
be to uninitialized and/or deallocated memory.)  Invalid values should
be printed as @samp{nonsensical} (@pxref{Data trace records}).

It is desirable to print @samp{nonsensical} rather than an invalid value,
for two reasons.  First, outputting nonsense values can degrade
invariant detection; patterns in the valid data may be masked by noise
from invalid values.  Second, an attempt to access an invalid value can
cause the instrumented program to crash!  For instance, suppose that
pointer @samp{p} is not yet initialized --- the pointer value refers to
some arbitrary location in memory, possibly even an address that the
operating system has not allocated to the program.  An attempt to print
the value of @samp{*p} or @samp{p->field} will result in a segmentation
fault when @samp{*p} is accessed.  (If you choose never to dereference a
pointer while performing instrumentation, then you do not need to worry
about invalid references.  However, you will be unable to output any
fields of a pointer to a struct or class, making your front end less
useful.  You will still be able to output fields of a regular variable
to a struct or class, but most interesting uses of structs and classes
in C and C++ are through pointers.)

C relies on the programmer to remember which variables are valid, and
the programmer must take care never to access invalid variables.
Unfortunately, there is no simple automatic way to determine variable
validity for an arbitrary C program.  (Languages with automatic memory
management, such as Java, do not pose these problems.  All variables
always have an initial value, so there is no danger of printing
uninitialized memory, though the initial value may not be particularly
meaningful.  Because pointed-to memory is never deallocated, all
non-null pointers are always valid, so there is no danger of a
segmentation fault.)

An instrumenter needs information about validity of variable values.
This could be obtained from the programmer (which requires work on the
part of the user of Daikon), or obtained automatically by creating a new
run-time system that tracks the information (which requires a more
sophisticated front end).

In addition to determining which variables are uninitialized and which
pointers are to allocated memory, there are additional problems for a C
front end.  For example, given a char pointer @samp{*c}, does it point
to a single character, or to an array of characters?  If it points to an
array of characters, how big is that array?  And for each element of the
array, is that element initialized or not?


The problem of tracking C memory may seem daunting, but it is not
insurmountable.  There exist many tools for detecting or debugging
memory errors in C, and they need to perform exactly the same memory
tracking as a Daikon front end must perform.  Therefore, a Daikon front
end can use the same well-known techniques, and possibly can even be
built on top of such a tool.  For instance, one C front end, named Kvasir, is
built on top of the Valgrind tool (@uref{http://valgrind.org/}),
greatly reducing the implementation effort.  Valgrind only works under
Linux, but a C front end for another platform could build on a similar
tool; many other such tools exist.


There are two basic approaches to instrumenting a C program (or a
program in any other language):  instrument the source code, or
instrument a compiled binary representation of the program.  In each
case, additional code that tracks all memory allocations, deallocations,
writes, and reads must be executed at run time.  Which approach is most
appropriate for you depends on what tools you use when building your C
instrumentation system.


In some cases, it may not be necessary to build a fully general C
instrumentation system.  You may be able to craft a smaller, simpler
extension to an existing program --- enabling that program (only) to
produce files for Daikon to analyze.

For instance, many programs use specialized memory allocation routines
(customized versions of @code{malloc} and @code{free}), in order to
prevent or detect memory errors.  The information that such libraries
collect is often sufficient to determine which variable values should be
printed, and which should be suppressed in favor of printing
@samp{nonsensical} instead.


The presence of memory errors --- even in a program that @emph{appears}
to run correctly --- makes it much harder to create Daikon's output.
Therefore, as a prerequisite to instrumenting a C program, it is usually
a good idea to run a memory checker on that program and to eliminate any
memory errors.

@c If you don't have a memory checking tool, then what platform are you
@c on??  But you could use some Very simple half-measures such s zeroing
@c out memory when it is allocated (always use @code{calloc}, never
@c @code{malloc}) and when it is deallocated, and zeroing out pointers
@c when they are freed.

@c Windows is Phoenix:

@node    New suppressors
@section New suppressors

@cindex adding new suppressors
@cindex new suppressors
@cindex suppressors, adding new

As mentioned in @ref{Daikon internals}, one way to make Daikon more
efficient, and to reduce clutter in the output to the user, is to reduce the
number of redundant invariants of various kinds.  This section describes
how to add a new suppressor relation, such that if invariant A implies
B, B is not instantiated or checked as long as A holds, saving time and
space.  Suppression implications use some terminology.  A
@dfn{suppressor} (defined in the class @code{NISuppressor}) is one of a
set of invariants (@code{NISuppression}) that imply and suppress a
@dfn{suppressee} invariant (@code{NISuppressee}).  The set of all of
the suppressions that suppress a particular @var{suppressee} is stored in the
class @code{NISuppressionSet}.

Adding a new suppression is straightforward when the invariants involved
do not have any state.  Define the @var{suppressee} and
each of the suppressions that suppress it using the corresponding
constructors.  Add the method @code{get_ni_suppressions} to the class
of the invariant being suppressed and return the appropriate
suppression set.  Make sure that @code{get_ni_suppressions} always
returns the same suppression set (i.e., that storage to store
the suppressions is only allocated once).  Normally this is
done by defining a static variable to hold the suppression sets
and initializing this variable the first time that @code{get_ni_suppressions}
is called.

The following example defines suppressions for @samp{x == y} implies
@samp{x >= y} and @samp{x > y} implies @samp{x >= y}.

@exampleindent 1
@example
private static NISuppressionSet suppressions = null;

public NISuppressionSet get_ni_suppressions() @{
  if (suppressions == null) @{
    NISuppressee = new NISuppressee(IntGreaterEqual);

    NISuppressor v1_eq_v2 = new NISuppressor(0, 1, IntEqual.class);
    NISuppressor v1_lt_v2 = new NISuppressor(0, 1, IntLessThan.class);

    suppressions = new NISuppressionSet(new NISuppression[] @{
      new NISuppression(v1_eq_v2, suppressee),
      new NISuppression(v1_lt_v2, suppressee),
    @});
  @}
  return suppressions;
@}
@end example
@c restore default:
@exampleindent 5

For suppressions depending on the state of a particular invariant,
each @code{Invariant} has an @code{isObviousDynamically(VarInfo[] vis)}
method that is called once the state of other invariants has already
been determined.  This method returns a non-null value if this invariant
is implied by a fact that can be derived from the given @code{VarInfo}s.

For example, suppose division was not defined for divisors smaller than 1.
The following example defines an obvious check for @samp{x <= c}
(where c < 1 is a constant) implies @samp{y % x == 0}, written in the
Divides class.

@exampleindent 1
@example
public DiscardInfo isObviousDynamically(VarInfo[] vis) @{
  DiscardInfo di = super.isObviousDynamically(vis);

  PptSlice1 ppt_over1 = ppt.parent.findSlice(var1);

    return null;

    if(inv instanceof UpperBound) @{
      if(((UpperBound) inv).max() < 1) @{
        return new DiscardInfo(this, DiscardCode.obvious,

@node    Reading dtrace files
@section Reading dtrace files

If you wish to write a program that manipulates a @file{.dtrace} file, you
can use Daikon's built-in mechanisms for parsing @file{.dtrace} files.
(This is easier and less error-prone than writing your own parser.)

You will write a subclass of @code{FileIO.Processor}, then pass an instance
of that class to @code{FileIO.read_data_trace_files}.  Daikon will parse
each record in the trace files that you indicate, then will pass the parsed
version to methods in your processor.

For a simple example of how to use @code{FileIO.Processor}, see the file
@*
@file{daikon/java/daikon/tools/ReadTrace.java}.


@node    System.exit
@section System.exit

The Daikon codebase does not call @code{System.exit()}, except in a
dummy main method that catches @code{TerminationMessage}, which is the
standard way that a component of Daikon requests the JVM to shut down.

The reason for this is that calling @code{System.exit()} is usually a
bad idea.  It makes the class unusable as a subroutine, because it
might kill the calling program.  It can cause deadlock.  And it can
leave data in an inconsistent state (for example, if the program was in
the middle of writing a file, still held non-Java locks, etc.), because
the program has no good way of completing any actions that it was in the
middle of.  Therefore, it is better to throw an exception and let the
program handle it appropriately.  (This is true of instrumentation code
as well.)

To see the stack trace for a @code{TerminationMessage}, pass
@option{--config_option daikon.Debug.show_stack_trace=true} on the command
line.

@cindex debugging Daikon

@menu
* Track logging::
@end menu

@ref{Daikon debugging options,,,daikon,Daikon User Manual} describes
several command-line options that enable logging, which can be a useful
alternative to using a debugger when debugging Daikon.  Because Daikon
processes large amounts of data, using a debugger can be difficult.

This chapter describes some of the command-line options in more detail.


@node    Track logging
@section Track logging

@cindex logging
@cindex track logging

Often it is desirable to print information only about one or more specific
invariants.  This is distinct from general logging because it concentrates
on specific invariant objects rather than a particular class or portion of Daikon.
This is referred to as @dfn{Track} logging because it tracks particular
values across Daikon.

@c makeinfo doesn't like ',' in @var so we can't do this:
@c @var{class|class|...<var,var,var>@@ppt}
The @option{--track @var{class|class|...<var}@i{,}@var{var}@i{,}@var{var>@@ppt}}
option to Daikon
(@pxref{Daikon debugging options,,,daikon,Daikon User Manual})
enables track logging.
The argument to the @option{--track} option supplies three pieces of information:

@enumerate

@item The class name of the invariant (e.g., @code{IntEqual}).
Multiple class arguments can be specified separated by pipe symbols
(@samp{|}).

@item The variables that are used in the invariant (e.g., @code{return},
@code{size(this.s[])}).  The variables are specified in angle brackets
(@samp{<>}).

@item The program point of interest (e.g.,
@code{DataStructures.StackAr.findMin()V:::ENTER}).
The program point is preceded by an at sign (@samp{@@}).

@end enumerate

Each item is optional.
For example:
@example
IntEqual<x,y>@@makeEmpty()
LessThan|GreaterThan<return,orig(y)>@@EXIT99
@end example

Multiple @option{--track} switches can be specified. The class, program point,
and each of the variables must match one of the specifications in order
for information concerning the invariant to be printed.

Matching is a simple substring comparison.  The specified item must be
a substring of the actual item.  For instance, @code{LessThan} matches
both @code{IntLessThan} and @code{FloatLessThan}.

Program points and variables are specified exactly as they are seen in
normal Daikon invariant output.  Specifically, @code{Ppt.name} and
@code{VarInfo.name.name()} are used to generate the names for comparisons.

Invariants are not the only classes that can be tracked.  Any class name
is a valid entry.  Thus, for example, to print information about derived
sequence variables from sequence @code{this.theArray[]} and scalar
@code{x} at program point @code{DisjSets.find(int):::EXIT}, the tracking
argument would be:

@exampleindent 1
@smallexample
SequenceScalarSubscriptFactory<x,this.theArray[]>@@DisjSets.find(int):::EXIT
@end smallexample
@c restore default:
@exampleindent 5

There are two configuration options that can customize the output.  The
option @option{daikon.Debug.showTraceback} will output a stack trace on
each log statement.  The option @option{daikon.Debug.logDetail} will cause
more detailed (and often voluminous) output to be printed.  For more
information, @pxref{Configuration options,,,daikon,Daikon User Manual}.

Note that all interesting information is not necessarily logged.
It will often be necessary to add new logging statements for the specific
information of interest (@pxref{Adding track logging}).
This is covered in the next section.

@node       Adding track logging
@subsection Adding track logging

@cindex adding track logging

When you add a new invariant, derived variable, or other component to
Daikon, you should ensure that it supports track logging in the same way
that existing components do.  This section describes how to do so.

Track logging is based
around the class name, program point name, and variables of interest.
Track logging methods accept these parameters and a string to be printed.
@file{Debug.java} implements the following basic log methods:

@example
log (String)
log (Class, Ppt, String)
log (Class, Ppt, VarInfo[], String)
@end example

@noindent
The first uses the cached version of the @code{Class}, @code{Ppt},
and @code{VarInfo} that
was provided in the constructor.  The second uses the specified
variables and the @code{VarInfo} information from @code{Ppt}.
The third specifies each variable explicitly.

When logging is not enabled, calling the logging functions can take a
significant amount of time (because the parameters need to be evaluated and
passed).  To minimize this, a function @code{logOn()} is provided to see
if logging is enabled.  It is recommended that code of the following form
be used for efficiency:

@example
if (Debug.logOn()) @{
  Debug.log (getClass(), ppt, "Entering routine foo");
@}
@end example

Track logging also can work with other loggers.  Each of the logging
methods has an alternative version that also accepts a logger as the
first argument.  In this case, normal track logging is performed if
the class, @code{ppt}, and vars match.  If they don't match, the same
information is logged via the specified logger.  For example:

@example
if (Debug.logOn || logger.isLoggable (Level.FINE)) @{
  Debug.log (logger, getClass(), ppt, "Entering routine foo");
@}
@end example

@noindent
The above will print if either the tracking information matches or if the
specified logger is enabled.

Convenience methods are available for track logging invariants.  In this
case the class name, @code{ppt}, and variable information are all taken from the
invariant.  The available methods are:

@example
logOn()
logDetail()
log (String)
log (Logger, String)
@end example

@noindent
These correspond to the @code{Debug} methods described above.  They are
the recommended way to log information concerning invariants.

Track logging also provides one additional level of detail.  The function
@code{logDetail()} returns whether or not more detailed information
should be printed.  This should be used for information which is not
normally interesting or especially voluminous output.  Often statements
using @code{logDetail()} should be commented out when not in active use.


@node       Track log output
@subsection Track log output

@cindex track log output

Each call to a track log method will produce output in the same basic
format. Space for three variables is always maintained for consistency:

@example
@ daikon.Debug: <class>: <ppt>: <var1>: <var2>: <var3>: <msg>
@end example

@noindent
If @code{showTrackback} is enabled, the @samp{traceback} will follow each
line of debug output.

This chapter describes some of the techniques used in Daikon to make
it efficient in terms of time and space needed.  These techniques can
be enabled or disabled at the Daikon command line, as described in
@ref{Running Daikon,,Running Daikon,daikon,Daikon User Manual}.

@node    Avoiding work for redundant invariants
@section Avoiding work for redundant invariants

@cindex non-instantiation of invariants
@cindex non-checking of invariants
@cindex non-printing of invariants

Daikon reduces runtime and memory by avoiding performing work for
redundant invariants that provide no useful information to the user.
There are three basic types of optimization that can be performed for
uninteresting invariants:  non-instantiation, suppression, and
non-printing.

@dfn{Non-instantiation} prevents the creation of an invariant because
the invariant's truth value is statically obvious (from the semantics
of the programming language), no matter what values may be seen at run
time.  Two examples are @samp{A[i] is an element of A[]} and @samp{size(A[])
>= 0}.  Non-instantiation is implemented by the by the
@code{isObviousStatically} method.
With the equality sets optimization (@pxref{Equality optimization}),
non-instantiation can only happen if all equality permutations are
statically obvious.  Note that @code{isObviousStatically} should
be used only for invariants that are known to be true.  Other code
presumes that any statically obvious invariants are true and can
be safely presumed when determining if other invariants are redundant.

An invariant can be @emph{suppressed} if it is logically implied by some
set of other invariants (referred to as @dfn{suppressors}).  A suppressed
invariant is not instantiated or checked as long as its suppressors
hold.  For example @samp{x > y} implies @samp{x >= y}.  Suppression has some
limitations.  It cannot use as suppressors or suppress sample dependent
invariants (invariants that adapt themselves to the samples they see and
whose equation thus involves a constant such as @samp{x > 42}).
Suppression also cannot use relationships between variables.  For
example, it cannot suppress @samp{x[i] = y[j]} by @samp{(x[] = y[]) ^ (i =
j)}.  Suppressor invariants can only use variables that are also in the
invariant that is being suppressed.  In this example, only invariants
using the variables @samp{x[i]} and @samp{y[i]} can be used as a suppressors.
See @ref{New suppressors} for more information.

@dfn{Non-printing} is a post-pass that throws out any invariants that
are implied by other true invariants.  It is similar to suppression, but
has none of the limitations of suppression.  But since it is only run as
a post pass, it cannot optimize runtime and memory use as suppression can.
Non-printing should be used only in cases where suppression cannot.
Non-printing is implemented by @code{ObviousFilter}, which calls the
@code{isObviousDynamically} method on invariants.  The
@code{isObviousStatically} method is also used by the non-printing
checks; it can be called at the end without reference to equality sets.

More detail can be found in the paper ``Efficient incremental algorithms
for dynamic detection of likely invariants'' by Jeff H. Perkins and
Michael D. Ernst, published in Foundations of Software Engineering in 2004;
the paper is available from
@uref{http://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/pubs/invariants-incremental-fse2004-abstract.html}.

@need 2000
@node    Dataflow hierarchy
@section Dataflow hierarchy

@cindex dataflow hierarchy
@cindex hierarchy

The dataflow hierarchy expresses relationships between variables at
different program points.  It is used to save time and space during invariant
generation and to prevent invariants from being printed multiple times.

Suppose there are two program points X and its parent Y.  Then every sample
seen at X is also seen at Y, and every invariant that is true at Y is also
true at X.

Variable @emph{z} in program point X is
related to variable @emph{z@quoteright{}} in another program point Y by a @dfn{flow} relation
if every sample seen of @emph{z} at X is also seen of @emph{z@quoteright{}} at Y.
Y is called a parent program point of X.

For example, all the field
variables in the @code{:::ENTER} program point of a method in class C relate to
the field variables in the @code{:::CLASS} program point of C.  This is because
the state of C, when in context at the entry @code{:::ENTER} program point, is
also in context at the @code{:::CLASS} program point.  Any invariant that holds
true on a parent program point must hold on the child program point.
Daikon saves time and space by only computing invariants at the highest parent
at which they apply.

@c original:
@c Daikon provides four ways that program points can be connected.
@c First, @code{:::CLASS} program points are parents of
@c all their method program points.  Second, between two classes that are
@c related by inheritance, corresponding program points relate --- for
@c example, @code{java.util.Vector:::CLASS} is a child of
@c @code{java.util.List:::CLASS}.  Third, when a program point contains
@c variables of a type whose @code{:::CLASS} program point is also available to
@c Daikon, the former program point's variables relate to the latter
@c program point's @code{:::CLASS} method.  For example, if X.y is of type Y, and
@c Y contains fields a and b, X.y, X.y.a and X.y.b relate to
@c Y.this, Y.b and Y.a.  Fourth, variables at @code{:::ENTER} program
@c points are related to the @samp{orig} versions at @code{:::EXIT} program points.

@ref{Program point declarations} describe how program points are
declared in a Daikon input file. Here we will describe how the
@code{parent} records are typically used to connect program points into
a dataflow hierarchy.

@itemize
@item
A program point that represents the @code{ENTRY} or @code{EXIT} of a
static method will have a @code{parent} record that points to the
@code{CLASS} program point for the containing class.

@item
A program point that represents the @code{ENTRY} or @code{EXIT} of a
non-static (instance) method will have a @code{parent} record that points to the
@code{OBJECT} program point for the containing object.

@item
A program point that represents a @code{CLASS}
will usually not have a @code{parent} record.

@item
A program point that represents a @code{OBJECT}
will have a @code{parent} record that points to the @code{CLASS}
program point for the object if the object has static data members.
@end itemize

When using Daikon, the relations used to describe the dataflow
hierarchy may result in some true invariants that are not reported at
some program points.  However, the invariant will be present in some
parent program point.  The dataflow hierarchy is used by default, but
can be disabled by the @option{--nohierarchy} flag.  When dataflow is enabled,
the only samples that are examined by Daikon are the @code{:::EXIT} program
points (plus @samp{orig} variables) since these contain a complete view of
the data, from which invariants at all other locations can be inferred.
For example, Daikon does not need to examine data at @code{:::ENTER} or
@code{:::OBJECT} program points which are parents of @code{:::EXIT} in the
dataflow hierarchy.


@node    Equality optimization
@section Equality optimization

@cindex equality optimization

When N variables are equal within a program point there will be
N(N-1)/2 pairwise invariants to represent the equality within the
equal variables, and N copies of every other invariant.  For example,
if a, b, and c are equal, then @samp{a == b}, @samp{a == c}, @samp{b == c} will be
reported as pairwise invariants, and @samp{odd(a)}, @samp{odd(b)} and @samp{odd(c)}
will be reported.  If the variables will always be equal, then
reporting N times the invariants is wasteful.  Daikon thus treats
equality specially.

Each group of variables that are equal from the start of inferencing
are placed in @dfn{equality sets}.  An equality set can hold an
arbitrary number of variables, and replaces the O(N^2) pairwise
equality invariants.  Every equality set has a leader or
@dfn{canonical} representation by a variable in the set.
Non-equality invariants are only instantiated and checked on the
leader.  When printing invariants, Daikon reports only invariants on
the leader.  The user can easily determine that @samp{odd(a)} and @samp{a == b}
imply @samp{odd(b)}.  Equality optimization can be turned off at the
command line with the @option{--noequality} flag.

Daikon has two sets of tests: unit tests (@pxref{Unit testing}) and
regression tests (@pxref{Regression tests}).  If there
are any differences between the expected results and the ones you get,
don't check in your changes until you understand which is the desired
behavior and possibly update the goals.

The Daikon distribution contains unit tests, but not regression tests
(which would make the distribution much larger).  The regression tests
appear in Daikon's version control repository (@pxref{Version control

@subsection Invariant format testing

This tests the formatting of invariants with specified input.  The
tests are configured in the file @file{InvariantFormatTest.commands} under
@file{daikon/test/}.  Make sure the @file{InvariantFormatTest.commands} file is
in the classpath when this tester is run or the tester will not work.
(It will just tell you that the file is not in the classpath.)

The file is formatted as follows:
@example
<fully qualified class name> [<instantiate args>]
<type string>
<goal string>+ <- 1 or more goal strings
<sample>* <- 0 or more samples
@end example

The file format should be the same regardless of blank or commented
lines except in the samples area. No blank lines or comments should
appear after the goal string before the first sample or between parts
of samples (these lines are used to determine where sample
lists end). This will be remedied in a future version of the tester.

@table @code
@item Instantiate args
These are optional additional arguments to the static
instantiate method of the class.  Each argument consists of the type (boolean
or int) followed by the value.  For example:
@exampleindent 1
@example
boolean true
int 37 boolean false
@end example
@c restore default:
@exampleindent 5

@item Type string:
A type string must consist of one or more of the following literals:
@samp{int}, @samp{double}, @samp{string}, @samp{int_array},
@samp{double_array}, or @samp{string_array}, separated by spaces.
This string represents the
types that an invariant is supposed to compare For instance, a binary
integer comparison would have type string @samp{int int}.  A pairwise
sequence comparison would have type string @samp{int_array int_array}.

@item Goal string:
The goal string must start with the prefix @samp{Goal }, and then
continue with @samp{(<format type>): },
where format type is the format in which the invariant will
print. After this the representation of the invariant must occur. It
must represent the invariant result exactly as printed, even white
space is significant (as proper formatting should be correct down to
the whitespace). The first variable (the one corresponding to the
first type in the type string) corresponds with @samp{a}, the second with
@samp{b} and so on. Format the type string accordingly. (In samples, the
value of @samp{a} is read first, possibly followed by @samp{b}, and then
possibly @samp{c}, depending on the arity of the invariant.)

@exampleindent 1
@example
Example:
Type string, Goals
 |             |
\|/            |
int           \|/
Goal (daikon): a >= -6
Goal (java): a >= -6
Goal (esc): a >= -6
Goal (ioa): a >= -6
Goal (jml): a >= -6
Goal (simplify): (>= |a| -6)
@end example
@c restore default:
@exampleindent 5

@noindent
Note that the spacing on the goal lines is exact, that is, no extra
spaces are allowed and no spaces are allowed to be missing. So the
exact format is again:
@example
Goal<1 space>(<format name>):<1 space><goal text>
@end example

@item Samples:
Values formatted according to the type string, one value per
line Make sure that the samples provided are actually instances of that
particular invariant (That is, if the desired invariant is @samp{a < b}, then
the first number of each sample better be less than the second)

@c The below is not necessary since we don't check this before formatting
@c
@c Also be
@c sure to have enough samples to ensure the invariant is apparent (and
@c probable) to Daikon (6-8 will do for most binary integer comparisons,
@c 1-3 for array-based comparisons) Example: Formatting for
@c samples of a binary integer comparison

Arrays and strings must be formatted according to the Daikon @file{.dtrace} file
convention (for a full description, @pxref{File formats}).  This
states that arrays must be surrounded in brackets (start with @samp{[}, end
with @samp{]}), and entries must be separated by a space.  Strings must be
enclosed in quotes (@samp{"}). Quotes within a string can be represented by the
sequence @samp{\"}.

For example:
@exampleindent 1
@example
[1 2 3 4 5] - an array with the elements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
"aString" - a string
"a string" - also legal as a string
"\"" - the string with the value "
["a" "b" "c"] - an array of strings

int int        <- type string
Goal: a < b    <- goal string, no comment/blank lines after this
1              <- or before this
2
2              <-|__ Pair of values (a = 2 , b = 3)
3              <-|
@end example
@c restore default:
@exampleindent 5

@noindent
Other examples are in the existing test file
(@file{InvariantFormatTest.commands}).
@end table

The output of a test run can be converted into goals by using the
@option{--generate_goals} switch to the tester as follows:
@example
java daikon.test.InvariantFormatTester --generate_goals
@end example

@noindent
Note that this test is included in the set of tests performed by the
master tester, and so it is not necessary to separately run this test
except to generate goal files.

Furthermore, this framework cannot parse complex types from files
unless they contain a @code{public Object valueOf(String s)}
function. Otherwise the program has no was of knowing how to create
such an object from a string. All primitives and the String type are
already recognized.

@node       Sample Testing
@subsection Sample Testing

Sample testing tests various components of Daikon as samples are being
processed.  A file (normally @file{daikon/test/SampleTester.commands})
specifies a @file{.decls} file to use, the samples for each @samp{ppt/var},
and assertions
about Daikon's state (such as whether or not a particular invariant exists).

Each line of the file specifies exactly one command.  Blank lines and
leading blanks are ignored.  Comments begin with the number sign (@samp{#}) and
extend to the end of the line.  The type of command is specified as the
first token on the line followed by a colon.  The supported commands
are:

@deffn {SampleTester Command} decl: decl-file
This command specifies the declaration file to use.  This is a normal
@file{.decls} file that should follow the format defined in the user manual.
@end deffn

@deffn {SampleTester Command} ppt: ppt
This command specifies the program point that will be used with following
vars, data, and assert commands.  The program point should be specified
exactly as it appears in the @file{.decls} file.
@end deffn

@deffn {SampleTester Command} vars: var1 var2...
Specifies the variables that will be used on following data lines.
Each variable must match exactly a variable in the @code{ppt}.  Other
variables will be treated as missing.
@end deffn

@deffn {SampleTester Command} data: val1 val2...
Specifies the values for each of the previously specified variables.  The
values must match the type of the variables.  A single dash (-) indicates
that a variable is missing.
@end deffn

@deffn {SampleTester Command} assert: assertion
Specifies an assertion that should be true at this point (@pxref{Assertions}).
The negation of an assertion can be specified by adding an exclamation
point before the assertion (for example: @code{!inv("x > y", x, y})).

@subsubsection Assertions

Assertions are formatted like function calls: @code{<name>(arg1, arg2, ...)}.
The valid assertions for the assert: command are:

@deffn Assertion inv format var1 ...

The @code{inv} assertion asserts that the specified invariant exists in the
current @code{ppt}.  The @var{format} argument is the result of calling
@code{format()} on
the invariant.  This is how the invariant is recognized.  The remaining
arguments are the variables that make up the invariants slice.  These
must match exactly variables in the @code{ppt}.  The @code{inv} assertion
returns true if and only if the slice exists and an invariant is found
within that slice that
matches @var{format}.

Optionally, @var{format} can be replaced by the fully qualified class name of
the invariant.  In this case, it is only necessary for the class to match.
@end deffn

More assertions can easily be added to @file{SampleTester.java} as required.

@node    Regression tests
@section Regression tests

@cindex regression tests

The regression tests run Daikon on many different inputs and compare
Daikon's output to expected output.  They take about an hour to run.

The regression tests appear in the @file{$DAIKONDIR/tests/} directory.  Type
@command{make} in that directory to see a list of Makefile targets.  The
most common target is @command{make diffs}; if any output file has
non-zero size, the tests fail.  You do not generally need to do
@command{make clean}, which forces re-instrumentation (a possibly slow
process) the next time you run the tests.

As when you install or compile Daikon, when you run the tests
environment variable @env{DAIKONDIR}
should be set.  Additionally, environment variable
@env{JAVA_HOME} should be the directory containing the Java JDK@.

You should generally run the regression tests before checking it a
change (especially any non-trivial change).  If any of the regression
test diffs has a non-zero size, then your edits have changed Daikon's
output and you should not check in without carefully determining that
the changes are intentional and desirable (in which case you should update the
goal output files, so that the diffs are again zero).

There are several subdirectories under @file{$DAIKONDIR/tests/}, testing
different components of the Daikon distribution (such as Kvasir,
@pxref{Kvasir,,,daikon,Daikon User Manual}).  Tests of the
invariant detection engine itself appear in
@file{$DAIKONDIR/tests/daikon-tests/}.

Each Makefile under @file{$DAIKONDIR/tests} includes
@file{$DAIKONDIR/tests/Makefile.common}, which contains the logic for all of
the tests.  @file{Makefile.common} is somewhat complicated, if only
because it controls so many types of tests.

@node       Kvasir regression tests
@subsection Kvasir regression tests


The Kvasir (Daikon C front-end) tests appear in the
@file{$DAIKONDIR/tests/kvasir-tests} directory. These tests run Daikon to ensure
that the Kvasir output is valid Daikon input. To run them, go to
@file{$DAIKONDIR/tests/kvasir-tests} or of its sub-directories and run
@command{make summary-w-daikon}. If any tests return @samp{FAILED}, then
you should look at the appropriate @file{.diff} file. If you feel that the
failure was actually a result of your Daikon changes and should be in fact
correct output, then run @command{make update-inv-goals} to update the Daikon
@file{invs.goal} file.



@node       Adding regression tests
@subsection Adding regression tests

@cindex adding new regression tests
@cindex new regression tests

Most Daikon regression tests are in subdirectories of
@file{$DAIKONDIR/tests/daikon-tests/}.
(There is also a @file{$DAIKONDIR/tests/chicory-tests/} directory,
but it is usually better to put tests in
@file{$DAIKONDIR/tests/daikon-tests/}, even if they are exercising
Chicory-specific behavior.)

To create a new test, perform the following steps.

@enumerate
@item
Create a new subdirectory of
@file{$DAIKONDIR/tests/daikon-tests/}.

@item
Put the source files for the test under @file{$DAIKONDIR/tests/sources/},
not in the test directory itself.  Your test may be able to re-use existing
Java source code that appears in that directory.

@item
It is expedient to copy a Makefile from another subdirectory, such as
@file{$DAIKONDIR/tests/@/daikon-tests/@/StackAr/}, then modify it.

The @file{Makefile} must contain at least the following entries.

@table @samp
@item MAIN_CLASS
Dot separated fully qualified name of the class that contains the main
entry point for the test.  For example,
@exampleindent 0
@example
MAIN_CLASS := DataStructures.StackArTester.
@end example
@c restore default:
@exampleindent 5

@item include ../../Makefile.common
This includes the common portion of the test Makefiles that does most
of the work.  See it for more information on the details of regression
testing.

@item instrument-files-revise:
A target that writes the list of files to instrument.  For example,
@exampleindent 0
@example
instrument-files-revise:
    echo "DataStructures/StackAr.java" >| $@{INST_LIST_FILE@}
@end example
@c restore default:
@exampleindent 5

@end table

If you run @command{make} (without a target), you will see a description of
all of the Makefile's functionality.  Most of that is inherited from
@file{$DAIKONDIR/tests/Makefile.common}.

@item
The @file{.goal} files are the expected results of running Daikon and its
associated tools.

For example, the @file{StackAr}
directory contains the following @file{.goal} files, among others:
@example
Makefile
Stackar.spinfo-static.goal
StackAr.txt-daikon.goal
StackAr.txt-esc.goal
StackAr.txt-jml.goal
StackAr.txt-merge-esc.goal
StackAr.txt-merge-jml.goal
@end example

@noindent
If you omit some @file{.goal} files, then the related tests will not be run.
(If you can't figure out how to ensure the tests are not run, it may be
easier to just add the additional @file{.goal} files.)

You can start out with the @file{.goal} files empty.
Execute @command{make diffs}, to produce output; the tests will fail
because the output is not identical to the empty @file{.goal} files.
When the test output is satisfactory, execute
@command{make update-goals} to copy the actual results to the @file{.goal} files.
Then, commit the goal files, Makefile, and source files
to the repository.

@item
Make the new test be run by adding to the appropriate list (usually
@samp{everything} or @samp{quick}) in
@file{$DAIKONDIR/tests/daikon-tests/Makefile}.

@end enumerate

For more information, see the comments in file
@file{$DAIKONDIR/tests/Makefile.common}.

entire codebase in Emacs.  (You need to run this command once per instance
of Emacs.)

The commands @code{M-x daikon-info} and @code{M-x

@node       Start up Eclipse
@subsection Start up Eclipse

Just run the command @command{eclipse} at the command shell.

There is one big catch:  take note of where you launch Eclipse and
@b{always} launch Eclipse from the same location. For example, you might
want to alias run-eclipse with @command{cd $HOME; eclipse}.
For convenience, this is already done for you if you source the
@file{daikon-dev.bashrc} startup script.
There are ways around the launch location inconvenience, such as
the -data switch, but the alias trick should be the simplest and least
confusing workaround.


It is strongly recommended that you make the following customizations to Eclipse:

@exampleindent 1
@smallexample
Window >> Preferences >> Workbench >> Refresh Workspace on Startup
Window >> Preferences >> Java >> Compiler >> Problems >> Unused imports >> Ignore
Window >> Preferences >> Java >> Compiler >> Style >> Non-static access >> >> Ignore

@end menu

@node          Import existing project
@subsubsection Import an existing project

First, do @command{cp $DAIKONDIR/java/.classpath-pag $DAIKONDIR/java/.classpath}

Second, import Daikon into Eclipse.  To import:  start Eclipse, then choose
menu item @samp{File->Import->ExistingProjectIntoWorkspace}, then enter (the full
name of) directory @file{$DAIKONDIR/java} for Project Contents.

Those two steps are all there is to it!

(This simple procedure works because there are already
@file{.project} and @file{.classpath} files in @file{$DAIKONDIR/java}.
To import a project that doesn't have these files, you would need to create
them (for instance, copy them from Daikon's), or else follow a different
procedure to work on your project in Eclipse.)


@node          Import different project
@subsubsection Importing a different existing project

Before working on code in Eclipse, you must import the code into
the Eclipse workspace.  You also need to set up various compilation
settings and specify jars and classes that should be in the
compilation classpath.  (By default, Eclipse does not use your
environment @env{Classpath}.)

@enumerate
@item
Change to the Java perspective by selecting "Java Perspective" in
the perspective menu on the far-left tool panel.  You should see some
of the windows move around to a structure similar to the screenshot
below.

@item
Select the menu item File->New->Project

@item
On the popup window, select Java Project and click Next

@item
Call the project @samp{Daikon} or some other appropriate name and
click Next.

@item
On the next window, create a new folder in
the project called @file{src}, and answer Yes to the next dialog box asking
you to confirm a change in the build directory. Select @samp{Ok} and you
should see the new Project as a small folder icon in the package
explorer.

@item
Select the menu item File->Import

@item
On the next popup window, select @samp{File System} and click
Next. Browse to the folder containing your source code.  Using the
standard @samp{PAG} setup, the folder should be @file{$DAIKONDIR/java}. The import
destination should be @file{Daikon/src}.  Check the boxes for including
Daikon, @samp{jtb}, and plume.

@item
Finally, add the required jars for Daikon by right-clicking on
the project and selecting the Properties menu.  Select "Java Build
Path", then "Libraries", then "Add External Jars" and add @file{tools.jar},
and the files in @file{daikon/java/lib/}, namely
@file{java-getopt.jar},
@file{junit-4.12.jar},
and
@file{plume.jar}.
(See your @env{CLASSPATH}
environment variable for full pathnames to these files.)
@end enumerate

Note that if you follow these directions, then
@b{the compiled classes do not appear in the directory from
which you imported in the previous step}.
Instead, the compiled classes appear in the Eclipse workspace
directory. If you followed the setup instructions above, then the
compiled code will be in "$HOME/.eclipse/Daikon/bin", which you
should add to your @env{CLASSPATH} in order to use the updates you make from
Eclipse.


@node       External tools
@subsection Interaction with external tools

Eclipse compiles your project whenever you save.
However, it parses frequently during editing and issues most or all of the
errors and warnings that the compiler would have.  In order to clear a
warning/error (in the Task List), you must save the file, however.

If you change files outside Eclipse, you should refresh Eclipse, via
right-clicking on the project or via menu item File >> Refresh.


@node       Eclipse debugger
@subsection Using the Eclipse debugger

To begin debugging, you can click on the bug icon in the toolbar or
select Run->Debug from the menu.  You will see the same window as if
you selected Run->Run, but when the Java application launches, Eclipse
will switch to the Debugging Perspective, which reveals many windows
such as the stack trace window, the variable values window, and the
step control panel.

Debugging features (window locations given for default setup):

@itemize
@item
Breakpoints: You can add breakpoints during editing by
double-clicking on the left margin area of the source code.  When
debugging, the program halts when it reaches a breakpoint.

@item
Stack Trace: Once the program halts at a breakpoint, the window
in the upper-left corner window show the stack trace.

@item
Step Controls: Once the program halts at a breakpoint, the panels
just below the stack trace allow you to step through the code one line
at a time (step over), resume execution as normal (resume), step down
into a method call (step into), or execute until leaving the current
method (Step return).

@item
Variables: On the top right window, there is a tab pane that displays
the values of objects and fields during a breakpoint halt.  You can also
type in any legal Java expression that could appear at the breakpoint,
and the window will display the value of the expression (don't forget to
put a semi-colon at the end of your expression!).

@node       Using Git with Eclipse
@subsection Using Git with Eclipse

This section has yet to be completed, although you can just do all the editing,
compiling, and
running from the Eclipse IDE while doing version control commands from the shell
or whatever current system you use.


@node    Editing daikon.texinfo
@section Editing daikon.texinfo

The Daikon manual appears in @file{doc/daikon.texinfo}.  The manual is
written using the Texinfo formatting system, which makes it easy to produce
HTML, info, or printed (PDF) output.

You can edit the manual using an ordinary text editor.  Emacs has a
useful Texinfo mode.  You can mimic the formatting commands that
already appear in the manual, but it's also a good idea to read the
@uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/,Texinfo documentation}.

If you wish to create a new section of the manual, insert two lines like
the following:

@example
@@node    @@@emph{Short title}
@@@emph{chapter} @@@emph{Long title}
@end example

@noindent
where you select the short and the long titles (which may
be the same), and you may replace @code{@@chapter} by @code{@@section},
@code{@@subsection}, or @code{@@subsubsection}.

Follow the Texinfo conventions for marking up text.  In particular:
@itemize
@item
Don't use regular double quotes (&quot;) in running text.  Instead, use
two single back quotes and two regular quotes, ``like this''.  Emacs will
do this substitution for you if you are using its Texinfo mode.

@item
Often, some other kind of markup is better than quotes:
@itemize
@item @code{@@code} is for names of classes, functions, variables, keywords, and
      other fragments of source code.
@item @code{@@var} is for meta-syntactic variables, not for referring to variables
      that appear literally in the source code.
@item @code{@@file} is for the names of files.
@item @code{@@option} is for command-line options.
@item @code{@@samp} is for sample input or output.  (Alternatively, you can use
      @code{@@example} to set off longer input/output strings.)
@item @code{@@command} is for command lines.
@end itemize

@item
Examples shouldn't include extra spaces on the left for
indentation since Texinfo already adds some indentation.  Remember
that in code examples you need to replace all curly braces with @{ and @}
to quote them for Texinfo.

@item
Don't mix @code{@@example} and @code{@@smallexample} in the same section since it
looks funny to have examples in two different sized fonts.  If your example
is too wide to fit on the page with @code{@@example}, it's better to insert some
line breaks to make it more readable than to shrink the font.
@end itemize

Once you have edited the manual, run @command{make} twice (yes, you must run
it twice) in order to generate formatted versions of the manual
(@file{daikon.}@{@file{html},@file{pdf}@}).



@node    Distribution
@chapter Making a distribution

This section provides the instructions for publishing a Daikon distribution,
a.k.a.@ making a release.
If you only want to
create the @file{daikon.tar} or @file{daikon.tar.gz} file in your own
directory, then simply run @command{make daikon.tar} or @command{make daikon.tar.gz}.

Official releases have even version numbers (e.g., 4.6.4) and
intermediate work has odd version numbers (e.g., 4.7.3).  This means
as you prepare for a release the current version number is probably odd.  It will
be updated as one of the steps in the release process.  After making the
distribution, one of the final steps is to increment the version number again to
prepare for subsequent development.  This system has the useful side effect
of allowing the build and test process to be repeated to fix a problem
without having to worry about updating or resetting the version number.
Another advantage is to reinforce, to people who are working from the
version control repository, that they are not using the released version,
because the version numbers differ.

The Daikon distribution site is located at
@uref{http://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/} and is served from the UW CSE
file system at
@file{/cse/web/research/plse/daikon}.
In order to be able to write to the distribution site, your CSE user id must be
a member of the @samp{plse_www} Unix group.

For each of the major steps below, an
approximate elapsed time is listed.  These timings are up to date as of December 2015.
They were measured on a quad x86-64 based
machine at @nospellcheck{3.4GHz} with @nospellcheck{16GB} of memory
(buffalo.cs.washington.edu).
Barring any difficulties,
the entire process
will take at least two hours --- but could be much more depending on the number of
different platforms on which you test the release.

Each of the steps below assumes that you are using the Bash shell.

If any of the jobs is not passing, then correct the problem and wait for
the jobs to complete and pass.
The delay to wait for this to happen is a reason that you should avoid
making changes to Daikon on the release day.  Instead, you should make
changes the day before to permit the continuous integration jobs to run
overnight.

Once you have successfully reached this point, you are ready to make a release

The following command will verify that @file{doc/CHANGES} is up-to-date and then list

The result of the command above should be:

@example

@end example

@noindent
If the command output lists any files, they need to be

Set the version number in file @file{$DAIKONDIR/doc/VERSION}
to an even number.
You may do this manually, or if the revision number just needs to be incremented
by 1 (to go from odd to even) you may use:

@c "cd $DAIKONDIR" because the previous commands changed the working directory
@example
make update-dist-version-file
@end example

Note that if a new feature has been added, or if some change has made
the current version incompatible from the previous release (such a
change in the dtrace file format or revised names for tool options),
then you should manually edit the VERSION file to increment the minor
version number and reset the revision number to zero.

Optionally, override the distribution date (default: today) by
redefining the environment variable @command{TODAY}:

@example
export TODAY='November 1, 2013'

It is important to build the release candidate from a clean enlistment.
This is to ensure we are testing only the files intended for release and
that those files are the same as a user would receive with a clone of
the repository. This needs to be done in a separate, new Bash command
shell.
The following commands get a fresh clone of Daikon, set some
environment variables and then
build everything to be distributed and copy it to the temporary staging area
@c not @uref{...} because we don't want robots to notice and crawl the link
(http://plse.cs.washington.edu/staging-daikon/).

@c can't use 'daikon' as will conflicit with jar build if no '/scratch' on system.

@example
mkdir -p /tmp/$USER
rm -rf /tmp/$USER/stage-daikon
git clone --depth 3 https://github.com/codespecs/daikon /tmp/$USER/stage-daikon
cd /tmp/$USER/stage-daikon
export DAIKONDIR=`pwd`
export JAVA_HOME=/homes/gws/markro/jdk8
export CHECKERFRAMEWORK=<path to lastest version of Checker Framework tools>
source scripts/daikon.bashrc
make staging
@end example

The final output of this command
will be a list of files that were added/removed since the
last release.
If any of these differences is unexpected, then investigate.
If any corrections are required, do so back in the main
repository, commit the changes and
then repeat this step.

[Time: 23 min]


@need 1000
@item
Next, check the staging website to see if it has any broken document links.

@example
make check-for-broken-doc-links
@end example

Review @file{check.log} and make corrections as appropriate.

In some cases a "403 Forbidden" error is transient, due to the website
being down.  You can check such links by hand.

If the URL is correct but cannot be checked (for example, because the website
prohibits spiders or because the URL  redirects to another URL but you prefer
to keep the first URL in your document), then you may need to add lines to
an appropriate part of file @file{$DAIKONDIR/plume-lib/bin/checklink-args.txt}.

In most cases (and for most 404 errors), you should fix the document with
the incorrect link.
Here is a workflow that may be used to deal with broken links:
@itemize
@item
Use the @samp{Wayback Machine}, http://archive.org/web/, to see what the old content was.
@item
Do a web search to see if the page has relocated elsewhere.
@item
If the web search is not successful, email the maintainer of the old content.
@end itemize

Note that you must fix problems in the original repository,
not in the drop directories. This means:
@itemize
@item
Switch back to your original Bash shell.
@item
Correct the file. (Most likely located beneath either
@file{$DAIKONDIR/doc} or
@file{$BIBDIR} (@file{~/bib/} if @file{$BIBDIR} is not set).)
@item
Commit the changes.
@item
Repeat the previous step to rebuild the release candidate.
@item
Repeat this step to verify your corrections.
@end itemize

If @file{check.log} contains an error message of the form:
@smallexample
List of broken links and other issues:
http://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/download/doc/developer/Requirements-for-compiling-Kvasir.html
  Line: 185
  Code: 200 OK
 To do: Some of the links to this resource point to broken URI fragments
        (such as index.html#fragment).
The following fragments need to be fixed:
        Requirements-for-compiling-Kvasir       Line: 185
@end smallexample
@noindent
This is probably caused by the way @command{makeinfo} deals with chapter splits via
indirect references through stub files.  Two @command{suppress-fragment} entries in
@file{../plume-lib/bin/checklink-args.txt} are required.  For the example above, these
would be:

@cindex repository
@cindex Git repository
@cindex Version control repository

@c Old info about how to create a distribution of the repository was
@c removed from this file on 12 Nov 2010.

Daikon's version control repository, available at
@uref{https://github.com/codespecs/daikon}, contains complete development
history starting from October 1, 2010, and partial development history
before that time.  The reason for this is that converting the full CVS
repository would create a repository that would be too
large for convenient use, and that would also be too large to upload to
Google Code or GitHub.  The original CVS repository is available for download from
@uref{http://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/download/inv-cvs/}, as files
@file{inv-cvsaa} through @file{inv-cvsai}.  Download
all 9 files, and then run the following commands to re-create the CVS
repository, which will be named @file{invariants/}:

@example
cat inv-cvsa? > inv-cvs-full.zip
unzip inv-cvs-full.zip
@end example


Developers can usually make do with the Git repository, which has
complete history for the Java source code.

The CVS repository is most often used by researchers --- for example, in
the testing community --- because it contains both a CVS repository and
a set of tests that is more extensive than those in the Daikon
distribution.  If you are a researcher who uses the Daikon version
control history, please let us know of any publications so that we can
publicize them at
@uref{http://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/pubs/#daikon-testsubject}.

The layout of the Daikon CVS repository differs slightly from that of
the distribution.  For example, the top-level directory is named
@file{invariants/} instead of @file{daikon/}.

The remainder of this section points out some pitfalls for such
researchers.  Although
these problems are easy to avoid, some previous published work has made
these mistakes; don't let that happen to you!

Recall that Daikon contains two sets of tests (@pxref{Testing}); you
should include both in any analysis of Daikon's tests.
(Or, if you can analyze only one of the two sets of tests, then clearly
explain that the regression tests are the main tests.)
The regression tests use Makefiles to avoid re-doing unnecessary work,
so any description of the time taken to run Daikon's tests should be a
measurement of re-running the tests after they have been run once, not
running them from a clean checkout or after a @command{make clean} command.

Daikon intentionally does not contain tests for third-party libraries
that are included (sometimes in source form) in the Daikon distribution.
As one example, the @file{java/jtb/} directory
contains an external library.  Therefore, any measurement of Daikon's code
coverage should not include such libraries, whether distributed in
source or as @file{.jar} files.

Historically, the file @file{doc/www/mit/index.html} in the CVS repository
contains information about how Daikon's developers use Daikon.
This file changes from
time to time --- for instance, it changed when a CVS branch was created
and later when development on it ceased (@pxref{Branches}).

@section Branches

@cindex branches, in CVS repository

The Daikon CVS repository contains two branches:  a main trunk and a
branch (named @samp{ENGINE_V2_PATCHES}) for version 2 of Daikon.

The CVS manual
(see section
@c This is the official source for the manual since it is linked from the
@c GNU CVS webpage (http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/).
@uref{https://web.archive.org/web/20140619100950/http://ximbiot.com/cvs/manual/cvs-1.11.23/cvs_5.html,
``Branching and merging''} of the manual @emph{CVS --- Concurrent Versions System})
describes CVS branches:

@quotation
CVS allows you to isolate changes onto a separate line of development,
known as a @dfn{branch}.  When you change files on a branch, those changes
do not appear on the main trunk or other branches.

Later you can move changes from one branch to another branch (or the
main trunk) by @dfn{merging}.  Merging involves first running
@command{cvs update -j}, to merge the changes into the working directory.
You can then commit that revision, and thus effectively copy the
changes onto another branch.
@end quotation

@c It is important that the following paragraph not contain any substrings
@c matching the regex /(Daikon version )[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)*/,
@c because such phrases are automatically changed at the time of a release to
@c mention the most recent Daikon version, while the intent of this paragraph
@c is to discuss historical versions.
In early January 2002 (or perhaps in late 2001), we created the
@samp{ENGINE_V2_PATCHES} branch at the @file{invariants/java/daikon level} of
the Daikon CVS repository.  Primary development continued along the CVS
branch @samp{ENGINE_V2_PATCHES}, which we called
``Daikon version @c trick version updater
2''  We
called the CVS trunk ``Daikon version @c trick version updater
3'' it was experimental, and very
few people ran its code or performed development on it.  Periodically,
all changes made to the branch would be merged into the trunk, as one
large checkin on the trunk.  Later, development on version 3 became more
common, some changes were merged from the trunk to the branch, and
version 2 was finally retired (and no more changes were made to the
branch) in December 2003.

A regular @command{cvs checkout} gets the trunk.  The @option{-r} flag specifies a
branch.  For example, to get the branch as of June 9, 2002, one could do

@example
cvs -d $pag/projects/invariants/.CVS co -r ENGINE_V2_PATCHES \
    -D 2003/06/09 invariants/java/daikon
@end example

Some warnings about analyzing historical versions of Daikon:
@enumerate
@item
When analyzing 2002 (and at least parts of 2003) you should be careful
to use the branch, not the trunk.  Or, you could analyze both (but as a
single development effort, not as separate efforts).
@item
When a programmer periodically merged changes from the branch to the
trunk (or vice versa), that operation resulted in very large checkins.
The times at which these merges occurred is indicated in file
@file{invariants/java/daikon/merging.txt} in the repository; for
example, this happened 34 times during calendar year 2002.  CVS checkins
for the branch properly attribute and time-stamp the work that appears
as a single large checkin on the trunk.
@item
There may be long periods of time in the branch (respectively, the
trunk) with no checkins, but that does not necessarily indicate a lacuna
in development, as checkins might have occurred in the meanwhile in the
trunk (respectively, the branch).
@end enumerate



@node     File formats
@appendix File formats

@cindex file formats

This chapter contains information about the file format of Daikon's
input files.  It is of most information to those who wish to write a
front end, also known as an instrumenter
(@pxref{Front ends (instrumentation),,,daikon,Daikon User Manual}).
A new front end enables Daikon to detect
invariants in another programming language.

Daikon's input is conventionally one or more @file{.dtrace} data trace
files.  (Another, optional type of input file for Daikon is a @dfn{splitter}
info file; @pxref{Splitter info file format,,,daikon,Daikon User Manual}.)
A trace file is a text file that consists of newline-separated
records.  There are two basic types of records that can appear in Daikon's
input:  program point declarations, and trace records.
The declarations describe the structure of the trace records.  The trace
records contain the data on which Daikon operates --- the run-time
values of variables in your program.

Each declaration names an instrumented program point and lists the
variables at that program point.  A program point is a location in the
program, such as a specific line number, or a specific procedure's entry or exit.
An instrumented program point is a place where the instrumenter may emit
a trace record.
A program point declaration
may be repeated, so long as the declarations match exactly (any
declarations after the first one have no effect).

A data trace record (also known as a @dfn{sample})
represents one execution of a program point.  The
record specifies the program point and gives the runtime values of each
variable.  The list of variables in the data trace record must be
identical to that in the corresponding declaration.  For a given program point,
the declaration must precede the first data trace record for the program
point.  It is not required that all the program point declarations
appear before any of the data trace records.

There exist some other declaration-related records;
@pxref{Declaration-related records}.

@node    Declarations in a separate file
@section Declarations in a separate file


Instead of placing both declarations and data trace records in a single
file, it is permitted to place the declarations in one or more
@file{.decls} @dfn{declaration files} while leaving the data trace records
in the @file{.dtrace} file.  This can be convenient for tools that
perform a separate instrumentation step, such as
@command{dfepl} (@pxref{dfepl,,,daikon,Daikon User Manual}).
Such a tool takes as
input a target program to be analyzed, and produces two outputs:  a
@file{.decls} file and an instrumented program.  Executing the
instrumented program produces a @file{.dtrace} file containing data
trace records for all the program points that appear in the
@file{.decls} file.  This approach works fine and is easier to
implement in certain situations, but has a few disadvantages.  It
requires the user to perform at least two steps --- instrumentation and
execution --- and the existence of two versions of the program
(instrumented and uninstrumented) can lead to confusion or extra work.
It is also more convenient to have a single file that contains all
information about a program, rather than multiple @file{.decls} files
that must be associated with the @file{.dtrace} file.

It is also permitted for a declaration to appear more than once in Daikon's
input.  The declaration must be identical in all occurrences.  This is
useful when running Daikon with multiple @file{.dtrace} files, each of
which contains its own declarations.


@node    Conventions
@section File format conventions


Daikon files are textual, to permit easier viewing and editing by humans.
Each record is separated by one or more blank lines.
To permit easier parsing by programs, each piece of information in a record
appears on a separate line.

Outside a record, any line starting with a pound sign (#) or double
slashes (//) is ignored as a comment.  Comments are not permitted
inside a record.

@node    Declarations
@section Declarations

@cindex declaration format
@cindex @file{.decls} file

The trace file (or declaration file) first states the declaration file format
version number (@pxref{Declaration version}).
It may also specify some other information about the file
(@pxref{Declaration-related records}).
Then, it defines each program point and its variables.

Indentation is ignored, so it may be used to aid readability.
Fields with defaults can be omitted.

As a rule, each line of the declaration file is of the form
@code{<field-name> <field-value>}.

Some additional details about the declaration file format appear in file
@code{daikon/doc/decl_format.txt} in the Daikon source code.

@subsubsection Declaration version

The declaration version record must be the first record in the file.

The declaration version record is as follows:
@example
decl-version <version>
@end example

@noindent
The current version is 2.0.

Previous versions (see @ref{Version 1 Declarations}) did not include a
version field and are identified by the lack of this field.

@subsubsection Input-language declaration

You can specify the language in which the program was written with a
record of the form

@example
input-language <language>

The language string is arbitrary and is not used.


@node          Variable comparability
@subsubsection Variable comparability

@cindex comparability, for variables
@cindex variable comparability
@cindex units of measurement, see variable comparability

The Variable comparability record indicates how the comparability field
of a variable declaration should be interpreted.

Its format is:
@example
var-comparability <comparability-type>
@end example

@noindent
The possible values for @var{comparability-type} are @code{implicit} and
@code{none}.

@code{implicit} means ordinary comparability as described in
@ref{Variable declarations}.  (The name @code{implicit} is retained
for historical reasons.)

This record is optional.  The @code{implicit} type is the default.


@node          ListImplementors declaration
@subsubsection ListImplementors declaration

This declaration indicates classes that implement the
@code{java.util.List} interface, and should be treated as sequences
for the purposes of invariant detection.  The syntax is as follows:

@example
ListImplementors
<classname1>
<classname2>
...
@end example

@noindent
Each @code{classname} is in Java format (for example, @file{java.util.LinkedList}).

The @option{--list_type} command-line option to Daikon can also be used to
specify classes that implement lists;

@node       Program point declarations
@subsection Program point declarations

The format of a program point declaration is:
@example
ppt <ppt-name>
<ppt-info>
<ppt-info>
...
<variable-declaration>
<variable-declaration>
...
@end example

@noindent
The program point name can include any character.  In the declaration
file,
@c Replacing blanks by \_ isn't important on this line, but is important
@c on other lines.
blanks must be replaced by @code{\_}, and backslashes must be escaped as @code{\\}.
Program point names must be distinct.

@c Note:
@c The Version 1 declaration file format specification is described in
@c "V1 pptname format", but it is not relevant for version 2.

While Daikon does not infer program point relationships from @code{ppt-name}s,
it does require these names to conform to a set syntax.
The following patterns are for the @code{enter}, @code{subexit},
@code{class} and @code{object} @code{ppt-type}s, respectively.

@example
<fully qualified class name>.<method/function name>(<argument types>):::ENTER
<fully qualified class name>.<method/function name>(<argument types>):::EXIT<id>
<fully qualified class name>:::CLASS
<fully qualified class name>:::OBJECT
@end example

@noindent
Since in most languages a method or function may have multiple exit points,
the @code{ppt-name} for a @code{subexit} @code{ppt-type} must be appended
with a unique id.  Typically, this is the corresponding source line number.

@c Note:
@c There is a little code in FileIO.java to support additional ppt-names ending
@c in THROWS and GLOBAL.  Neither Daikon or Kvasir currently use them.

The following information about the program point (@code{ppt-info}) can be specified:
@itemize
@item @code{ppt-type <type>}

Specifies the @var{type} of the program point.  Possible program point
types are @code{point}, @code{class}, @code{object}, @code{enter},
@code{exit}, @code{subexit}.  Except for @code{point} all of these
types are related to the program point hierarchy (see @ref{Dataflow hierarchy}).

A @code{point} program point is one that is @emph{not} involved in a
program point hierarchy.   This is normally used when the input is not
from a programming language or when is no dataflow hierarchy.

@item @code{flags <flags>}

Specifies one or more flags for this @code{ppt}.  The possible flags are:
@code{static}, @code{enter}, @code{exit}, @code{private}, @code{return}.
It should be noted that neither Daikon nor Kvasir currently use or
output this field.

@item @code{parent <relation-type> <parent-ppt-name> <relation-id>}

Specifies the program point hierarchy (@ref{Dataflow hierarchy}).

In particular, each @code{parent} field names one parent of this program
point.  A parent program point
is a point whose samples should include all of the samples at this
program point.  For example, an object program point is a parent of
each of the method program points in that object.

The @var{relation-type} is the type of parent-child relationship in
the hierarchy. There are a few relationship types used internally
by Daikon, but the only one output to the data files is @code{parent}.
@c types are: parent, user, enter-exit, exit-exitnn, merge-child and ppt-pptcond
A @code{parent} relationship is one where the program points themselves
are explicitly related, such as an enter and an exit point.  All of the
variables at one of the points exists at the other.  A @code{user}
relation is one where a class is used at another point, such as at an
enter point.  For example, if a reference to class A were passed to
routine @samp{r1}, the values found at enter and exit of @samp{r1} could
be applied to
the class/object program point for A.  By default @code{user} relations
are not used because they can be recursive.

The @var{relation-id} is a unique integer that identifies this parent
relation.  They are used when defining the the specific parent
relations for variables.

Multiple parent fields can be specified.

@c (unpublished notes to Daikon developers)
@c
@c The following features were added to Daikon to support the Galar
@c front end, which in turn supported the ClearView tool
@c (https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/pubs/automatic-patching-sosp2009.pdf).
@c Unfortunately, the Galar front end was never released.
@c
@c There are five undocumented items: ppt-func, ppt-length,
@c ppt-successors, ppt-basic_block and ppt-combined_basic_block.
@c
@c If the ppt-type is basic_block then the ppt-name is expected to be of
@c the form "<string>:0x<hex offset>:::BB".  I'm not clear what the
@c <string> represents or how it is used.  The main item is the <hex
@c offset> which is the offset from the start of the function to this basic block.
@c
@c The ppt-func record has a string argument for function_id.  I think
@c each basic_block ppt is supposed to have one of these records to
@c identify the containing function.
@c
@c The ppt-length record has a numeric argument for bb_length.  I think
@c each basic_block ppt is supposed to have one of these records
@c indicating the length of the basic block.  I'm assume this is in bytes not
@c instructions.
@c
@c The ppt-successors record has a list of string arguments that identify
@c the successor blocks of the current basic block.  I think these names
@c are supposed to be in the same format as the ppt-name.

@node       Variable declarations
@subsection Variable declarations
@cindex declaration file format

The format of a variable declaration is:
@example
variable <name>
  <variable-info>
  <variable-info>
  ...
@end example

@noindent
The variable name is arbitrary, but for clarity, it should match what is
used in the programming language.  All characters are legal in a name,
but blanks must be represented as @code{\_} and backslashes as
@code{\\}.

If the variable is an array, @code{..} marks the location of
array indices within the variable name.  Some examples of names are:
@example
this.theArray
this.theArray[..]
this.stack.getClass()
@end example

The following information about the variable (@code{variable-info})
can be specified:
@itemize

@item @code{var-kind <kind> [<relative-name>]}

Specifies the variable kind.  Possible values are: @code{field},
@code{function},
@code{array}, @code{variable}, @code{return}.  If @code{field} or
@code{function}
are specified, the relative name of the field or function must be
specified.  For example, if the variable is @code{this.theArray}, the
relative name is @code{theArray}.  Pointers to arrays are of type
@code{field}.  The arrays themselves (a sequence of values) are of
type @code{array}.  A var-kind entry is required in each variable block.

@item @code{enclosing-var <enclosing-var-name>}

The variable that contains this variable.  Required for fields and
arrays.  Required for functions that represent an instance method.
Forbidden for functions that specify a static method or a function in
a non-object-oriented language.
A variable is specified by its name.  The named variable must
be defined at the same program point.
If a variable is omitted (e.g., by the omit-var switch),
any variable for which it is the enclosing variable must be omitted as
well.

For example, if the variable is @code{this.theArray}, the
enclosing variable is @code{this}.

@item @code{reference-type pointer|offset}

Specifies the kind of reference for variables which are structures or
classes.  The possible values are @code{pointer} or @code{offset}.  In
C, @code{pointer} is used if the variable is a pointer, @code{offset}
is used when the structure is placed inline.  Pointer would be used
for all references to Java objects.  Defaults to pointer.

@item @code{array <dim>}

The number of array dimensions inherited or declared by this variable.
The valid values are 0 or 1.  This should be specified for any variable
that has multiple values.  If not specified it defaults to 0.  Future
versions of Daikon may support more levels of arrays.

@item @code{dec-type <language-declaration>}

This is what the programmer used in the declaration of the variable.
Names for standard types should use Java's names (e.g., @code{int},
@code{boolean}, @code{java.lang.String}, etc.),
but names for user-defined or language-specific
types can be arbitrary strings.  A @code{dec-type} entry is required in each
variable block.

@item @code{rep-type <daikon-type>}

This describes what will appear in the data
trace file.  For instance, the declared type might be @code{char[..]} but
the representation type might be @code{java.lang.String}.  Or, the declared
type might be @code{Object} but the representation type might be
@code{hashcode}, if the address of the object is written to the data trace
file.  A rep-type entry is required in each
variable block.

@cindex pointer variables, see @dfn{hashcode} type
@cindex hashcode type, for variables

The representation type should be one of @code{boolean}, @code{int},
@code{hashcode}, @code{double}, or @code{java.lang.String}; or an
array of one of those (indicated by a @code{[..]} suffix).

@code{hashcode} is intended for unique object identifiers like memory
addresses (pointers) or the return value of Java's
@code{Object.hashCode} method.  @code{hashcode} is treated like
@code{int}, except that the hashcode values are considered uninteresting
for the purposes of output.  For example, Daikon will print
@samp{@var{var} has only one value} instead of @samp{@var{var} == 0x38E8A}.


@item @code{flags <flags>}

One or more flags may optionally be specified.  Possible values are:
@itemize

@item @code{is_param}

Indicates that a given variable is a parameter to a procedure.  Some
procedures reassign parameters --- essentially using them as local
variables.  Such uses are not relevant to the procedure's external
specification.  The @code{is_param} flag causes Daikon not to print
certain invariants, if the variable has been reassigned.

@enumerate
@item
Invariants
that use the parameter variable @code{p} in its post-state form are not
printed.
@item
Invariants that use fields of @code{p} (such as @code{p.x})
are printed only if @code{p} has not changed.
@item
Some immutable
characteristics, such as the size of arrays and data types, are not
printed.  (These can change only if @code{p} is changed, but then, @code{p}
would no longer be interesting.)
@end enumerate

@item @code{no_dups}

Indicates that a collection can not contain duplicates.
If it cannot, Daikon does not check for some invariants that only have
meaning for collections that can contain duplicate elements.

@item @code{not_ordered}

Indicates that the order of a collection does not have meaning.  In
this case, Daikon does not check for element-wise comparisons between
it and other collections.

@item @code{nomod}

Indicates that the variable can never be modified.  For example, a
variable declared @code{static final} in Java.

@item @code{synthetic}

Indicates that the variable was added by the front end and is not
manifest in the input program.

@item @code{classname}

Indicates that the variable indicates the @code{classname} of its
enclosing variable.

@item @code{to_string}

Indicates that the variable is the string representation of its
enclosing variable.

@item @code{non_null}

Indicates that the variable can't take on a null value.  In this
case, Daikon will not check for the @samp{NonZero} invariant.

@item @code{is_property}

Indicates that the variable is a C# property (set by the Celeriac front
end).  It is used in output
formatting to remove the parentheses from a method call.

@item @code{is_enum}

Indicates that the variable is an enumerated type (set by the Celeriac
front end).  Daikon uses this information to suppress obvious invariants.

@item @code{is_readonly}

Indicates that the variable is read only (set by the Celeriac front
end).  Daikon uses this information to suppress obvious invariants.

@end itemize

@item @code{comparability <comparability-key>}

The @var{comparability-key} indicates which other variables are
comparable to this one.  The information specified here might have been
obtained dynamically, or via
type-inference-based static analysis, or in some other manner.

A comparability for a non-array type is a signed integer.  Two
variables at the same program point are considered comparable if both
integers are the same, or if either integer is negative (that is, a
negative number means ``comparable to every other variable'').  A
comparability for an array type contains an integer for each index
and for the contents; for instance, @samp{8[5]} means that the array
elements have comparability @samp{8} and the array indices have
comparability @samp{5}.  Similarly, @samp{5[22][17]} is a comparability for a
two-dimensional array.  An array comparison succeeds if comparisons over each
component succeed.

Variables at different program points are never compared to one another.
Use of the same number at different program points does not indicate any
relationship between the variables, and a given variable may have a
different comparability integer at different program points.

As an example, in the following code:
@example
int sum(int len, int[] a) @{
  int sum=0;
  for (int i=0; i++; i<len)
    sum += a[i];
  return sum;
@}
@end example

@noindent
variables @code{i} and @code{len} are comparable to one another (and
to indices of array @code{a}).  Furthermore, the result is comparable
to the elements of array @code{a}.  The comparability keys for these
variables might look like
@example
len     - comparability 5
a       - comparability 8[5]
return  - comparability 8
@end example

A comparability entry is required in each variable block.

@item @code{parent <parent-ppt> <relation-id> [<parent-variable>]}

Optionally specifies the parent variable of this variable in the program
point/variable hierarchy.  The @var{parent-ppt} is the name of the
parent program point.  The @var{relation-id} must be one of the
relationship ids specified for this program point.  The
@var{parent-variable} is the name of this variable's parent in the
parent program point.  If the names are the same, it can be omitted.

@item @code{constant <value>}

Optionally specifies a constant value for this variable.  If the variable has
a compile-time constant value that is specified in the declaration, then
the variable must be omitted from the data trace
records.

@item @code{function-args <arg1> <arg2> ...}

If this variable is computed as a function of some other variable,
specifies the arguments to the function; otherwise, the
@code{function-args} line must be omitted.
The arguments are specified by their
external variable name.  Multiple arguments are
blank separated.  For example
@example
function-args a.b this.f1
@end example

@noindent
specifies that the function takes two arguments which are @code{a.b} and
@code{this.f1}.  As with enclosing variables, each of the arguments must
be defined as variables.

@item @code{min-value <v>}

Optionally specifies the minimum possible value for this variable
(for instance, due to language-specific restrictions on the type). This
enables Daikon to suppress invariants that would be ``obvious'' in that
case, such as @code{var >= v}.

@item @code{max-value <v>}

Optionally specifies the maximum possible value for this variable
(for instance, due to language-specific restrictions on the type). This
enables Daikon to suppress invariants that would be ``obvious'' in that
case, such as @code{var <= v}.

@item @code{min-length <v>}

Optionally specifies the minimum possible length for this variable
(for instance, due to language-specific restrictions on the type). This
enables Daikon to suppress invariants that would be ``obvious'' in that
case, such as @code{size(var) >= v}.
Note that this item should be added to the @code{@emph{arrayname}[..]} entry
not the @code{@emph{arrayname}[..]} entry.

@item @code{max-length <v>}

Optionally specifies the maximum possible length for this variable
(for instance, due to language-specific restrictions on the type). This
enables Daikon to suppress invariants that would be ``obvious'' in that
case, such as @code{size(var) <= v}.
Note that this item should be added to the @code{@emph{arrayname}[..]} entry
not the @code{@emph{arrayname}[..]} entry.

@item @code{valid-values [<v1> <v2> ... <vN>]}

Optionally specifies all the possible values for this
variable (for instance, due to language-specific restrictions on the
type). This enables Daikon to suppress invariants that would be
``obvious'' in that case, such as @code{v is one of @{v1, v2, ..., vN@}}.

@end itemize


@node    Data trace records
@section Data trace records

@cindex data trace format
@cindex .dtrace file

A data trace record (also known as a @dfn{sample}) contains run-time value
information.  Its format is:
@example
<program-point-name>
this_invocation_nonce
<nonce-string>
<varname-1>
<var-value-1>
<var-modified-1>
<varname2>
<var-value-2>
<var-modified-2>
...
@end example

@noindent
In other words, the sample record contains:
@itemize @bullet
@item name of the program point

@item
optionally, an arbitrary string (a nonce) used to match up procedure
entries (whose names conventionally end with @code{:::ENTER}) with
procedure exits (whose names conventionally end with @code{:::EXIT}).
This is necessary in concurrent systems because there may
be several invocations of a procedure active at once and they do not
necessarily follow a stack discipline, being exited in the reverse order of
entry.  For non-concurrent systems, this nonce is not necessary, and
both the line @code{this_invocation_nonce} and the nonce value may be
omitted.



@item for each variable:
@itemize @bullet
@item name
@item value
@itemize @bullet
@item    if an integer: sequence of digits, optionally preceded by a minus sign.
Boolean values are written as the number 0 (for false) or the number 1
(for true).  For pointers, the value may be @code{null}.
@item    if a string: characters surrounded by double-quotes.  Internal
double-quotes and backslashes are escaped by a backslash.  Newlines and
carriage returns are represented as @samp{\n} and @samp{\r},
respectively.

@item    if an array: open bracket (@code{[}), elements separated by
spaces, close bracket (@code{]}).  (Also, the array name
should end in @samp{[..]}; use @samp{a[..]} for array contents,
but @samp{a} for the identity of the array itself.)
@end itemize

@cindex nonsensical values for variables
@cindex missing values for variables, see nonsensical values

@c the Daikon code sometimes calls this "missing" rather than "nonsensical".
The value representation may also be the string @code{nonsensical};
@pxref{Nonsensical values}.
A string or array @emph{value} is never @code{null}.  A @emph{reference} to a
string or array may be @code{null}, in which case the string or array
value is printed as @code{nonsensical}.

@item modified? (0, 1, or 2).
@cindex modified bit
This value is 0 if the variable has not been assigned to since the
last time this program point was executed, and 1 if the variable has
been assigned to since then.  It is safe for an implementation to
always set it to 1.  It is also safe to always set it to 0, because
Daikon corrects obviously incorrect modification bits (such as 0 for a
never-before-seen value).

The special value 2 should be used only (and always) when the value
field is @code{nonsensical}.

@end itemize

The variables should appear in the same order as they did in the
declaration of the program point, without omissions or additions.
@end itemize

@node       Nonsensical values
@subsection Nonsensical values for variables

Some trace variables and derived variables may not have a value because
the expression that computes it cannot be evaluated.  In such a
circumstance, the value is said to be nonsensical, it is written in the
trace file as @code{nonsensical}, and its modified field must be 2.
Examples include
@itemize
@item
@code{x} when @code{x} is uninitialized or deallocated,
@item
@code{x.y} when @code{x} is null (or uninitialized or deallocated)
@item
@code{a[i]} when @code{i} is outside the bounds of @code{a} (or
uninitialized or deallocated, or @code{a} is null, uninitialized, or
deallocated)
@end itemize

@noindent
For trace variables, it is the responsibility of the front end to
perform a check at run time whenever a variable's value is about to be
output to the trace, and to output the value @samp{nonsensical}
(@pxref{Nonsensical values}) rather than crashing the program or
outputting an uninitialized or meaningless value.  (Determining when an
expression's value is meaningless is the most challenging part of
writing an instrumenter for a language like C, since it requires
tracking memory allocation and initialization.)  For derived variables
created by Daikon, Daikon does the same thing, setting values to
@samp{nonsensical} when appropriate.  For controlling Daikon's output in
the presence of nonsensical values, see the
@option{daikon.Daikon.guardNulls} configuration option
(@pxref{General configuration options,,,daikon,Daikon User Manual}).


@node       Variables that do not appear in trace records
@subsection Variables that do not appear in trace records

A trace record should contain exactly the same variables as in the
corresponding declaration.  There is one exception:  for efficiency,
compile-time constants (e.g., static final variables in Java) are
omitted from the trace record, since they would have the same value
every time.

Furthermore, neither the declarations nor the trace records contain derived
variables (@pxref{Variable names,,,daikon,Daikon User Manual}).

@section Version 1 Declarations

@cindex @file{.decls} file (version 1)

This section describes the original version (1.0) of declaration
records.  These are now obsolete and should not be used.

A declarations file can contain program point declarations,
@code{VarComparability} declarations, and @code{ListImplementors declarations}.

@menu
* V1 Program point declarations::
* V1 pptname format::
* V1 VarComparability declaration::
* V1 ListImplementors declaration::

@node       V1 Program point declarations
@subsection V1 Program point declarations

The format of a program point declaration is:
@example
DECLARE
program-point-name
varname1
declared-type1 [# auxiliary-information1]
representation-type1 [= constant-value1]
comparable1
varname2
declared-type2 [# auxiliary-information2]
representation-type2 [= constant-value2]
comparable2
...
@end example

@noindent
Program point information includes:
@itemize @bullet
@item
name (@dfn{tag}) of this program point, an arbitrary string containing no
tab or newline characters.  This name contains information such as the
class name or method name; what information is contained depends on
which instrumenter is being used.  @xref{V1 pptname format}, for a full
specification of the naming format.


@item
for each variable:
@itemize @bullet
@item
name: a string containing no tabs or newlines.
@xref{Variable names,,,daikon,Daikon User Manual}.

@item
declared type: this is what the programmer used in the declaration of
the variable.  Array types must be suffixed by the proper number of
@samp{[]} to indicate their dimensionality.  Names for standard types
should use Java's names (e.g., @code{int}, @code{boolean}, etc.), but names for
user-defined or language-specific types can be arbitrary strings.

@item
auxiliary information: optionally, Daikon can be given information
about the meaning of the variable to help it better interpret the
values it later sees.  Information is provided as a comma-separated
list of items, with each item in the form of @samp{key = value}.  Unrecognized
keys are silently ignored.  All values are
either @samp{true} or @samp{false}.  Mainly, this information is used for
collections, which are presented to Daikon as arrays.  Valid keys are:

@table @code

@item hasDuplicates
Whether a collection can contain duplicates.  If it
cannot, Daikon does not check for some invariants that only have
meaning for collections that can contain duplicate elements.

@item hasOrder
Whether order has meaning for a collection.  If order does
not have meaning in a collection, then Daikon does not check for
element-wise comparisons between it and other collections.

@item hasNull
Whether zero has the special meaning null for the variable or
collection.  If it does, then Daikon checks for whether a value or the
elements in a collection are null.

@item nullTerminated
Whether a collection has a value (usually null) that
ends its representation.  If it does, then Daikon looks at the
collection's size and at the collection's size-1 as ``interesting''
values.  If it does not, then Daikon only looks at the collection's
size.

@item isParam
Whether a given variable is a parameter to a method.  If a
variable is a parameter, Daikon avoids printing some information that
would be considered uninteresting for parameters.  First, invariants
that use the parameter variable @code{p} in its post-state form are not
printed.  Second, invariants that use fields of @code{p} (such as @code{p.x})
are printed only if @code{p} has not changed.  Lastly, some immutable
characteristics, such as the size of arrays and data types are not
printed (both can be changed if @code{p} is changed, but then, @code{p}
would no longer be interesting).

@end table

@item
representation type:  this describes what will appear in the data
trace file.  For instance, the declared type might be @code{char[]} but
the representation type might be @code{java.lang.String}.  Or, the declared
type might be @code{Object} but the representation type might be
@code{hashcode}, if the address of the object is written to the data trace
file.

The representation type should be one of @code{boolean}, @code{int},
@code{hashcode}, @code{double}, or @code{java.lang.String}; or an
array of one of those (indicated by a @code{[]} suffix, as in Java).
Hashcodes are treated like integers, except that their actual values
are considered uninteresting for the purposes of output; they are
intended for unique object identifiers like memory addresses or the
return value of Java's @code{Object.hashCode} method.

The representation type may optionally be followed by an equals
sign and a value; in that case, the variable is known to have a
compile-time constant value and should be omitted from the data
trace file.
@end itemize
@item
@cindex comparability, for variables (@file{.decls} format version 1)
@cindex variable comparability (@file{.decls} format version 1)
comparable variables.  This information indicates
which other variables are comparable to this one.

The point of comparability is that Daikon should not compare unrelated
quantities.  For example, each person's height in centimeters may always
be less than their birth year, but it is not helpful for Daikon to
output @samp{height < birthyear}, because the two variables are measuring
incomparable quantities.  (In this case, the variables use different
units of measurement.)

Variable comparability information helps Daikon to avoid computing
information over unrelated variables.  This saves time and (more
importantly) improves the quality of Daikon's output.  For more details,
see the paper
@ifhtml
@uref{http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/pubs/invariants-relevance-icse2000-abstract.html,
, ``Quickly detecting relevant program invariants''}.

@ifnothtml
@uref{http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/pubs/invariants-relevance-icse2000-abstract.html,
  ``Quickly detecting relevant program invariants''}.
@end ifnothtml

Variable comparability information may be obtained dynamically
(@pxref{Dynamic abstract type inference (DynComp),,,daikon,Daikon User Manual}), via
type-inference based analysis, or in some other manner.  In any event,
Daikon reads it from the variable declarations.

A comparability for a non-array type is a signed integer.  Two variables
at the same program point
are considered comparable if both integers are the same, @emph{or} if either
integer is negative.
A comparability for an array type must contain an
integer for each index and for the contents; for instance, @samp{5[22][17]}
for a two-dimensional array.  Comparisons succeed if comparisons over
each component succeed.

Regardless of comparability, variables at different program points are
never compared to one another.  Use of the same comparability integer at
different program points does not indicate any
relationship between the variables, and a given variable may have a
different comparability integer at different program points.

As an example, in the following code:
@example
int sum(int len, int[] a) @{
  int sum=0;
  for (int i=0; i++; i<len)
    sum += a[i];
  return sum;
@}
@end example
variables @code{i} and @code{len} are comparable to one another (and
to indices of array @code{a}).  Furthermore, the result is comparable
to the elements of array @code{a}.  A declaration file for these
variables might look like
@example
len
int
int
5
a
int[]
int[]
8[5]
return
int
int
8
@end example

@end itemize

@c Future enhancements may include:
@c @itemize @bullet
@c @item
@c permit variables to be omitted if they haven't changed (but always
@c outputting the bit permits us to write a sanity checker)
@c @item
@c permit variables to appear in any order (not sure this is so worthwhile)
@c @item
@c specify which @file{.decl} files should be used (including their pathnames
@c and/or MD5 hashes)

@node       V1 pptname format
@subsection Program point name format specification

Instrumenting code creates a @file{.decls} file that contains program
point names such as:

@example
DataStructures.StackAr.push(java.lang.Object):::ENTER
DataStructures.StackAr.push(java.lang.Object):::EXIT99
PolyCalc.RatNum.RatNum(int, int):::ENTER
PolyCalc.RatNum.RatNum(int, int):::EXIT55
PolyCalc.RatNum.RatNum(int, int):::EXIT67
@end example

This section describes the format of these program point names.  Someone
writing an instrumenter for a new language must be sure to follow this
format specification.

A program point name is a string with no tabs or newlines in it.  The basic
format is @samp{@var{topLevel}.@var{bottomLevel}:::@var{pptInfo}}.
For the first example given above, the top level of the hierarchy would
be @code{DataStructures.StackAr}, the bottom level would be
@code{push(java.lang.Object)}, and the
program point information would be @code{ENTER}.

@var{topLevel} may contain any number of periods (@samp{.}). @var{bottomLevel}
and @var{pptInfo} may not contain any periods.  The string @samp{:::} may only
appear once.

@var{topLevel} and @var{pptInfo} are required (i.e., they must be non-empty),
as are the period to the right of @var{topLevel} and the colons to the
left of @var{pptInfo}.  However, @var{bottomLevel} is optional.

By convention, for Java @var{topLevel} consists of the class name, and
@var{bottomLevel} consists of the method name and method signature.

For C, @var{topLevel} consists of a filename (or a single period for
global functions), and @var{bottomLevel}
could consist of a function name and signature.
More precisely, names of C program points follow these conventions:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Names of program points for file-static functions are prefixed with the name
of the source file, with @samp{.} characters mapped to @samp{_},
followed by a @samp{.}.

@item Names of program points for
file-scope functions with external linkage are prefixed with @samp{..}.
For example, a global function program point might be named
@samp{..main():::ENTER}., the first period denoting that it is global in
scope and the second denoting the separator between the @var{toplevel}
and @var{bottomlevel} parts of the name.

@item
Names of C++ functions that are class or namespace members are prefixed
with the name(s) of their classes or namespaces, with the C++ @samp{::}
syntax mapped onto the Java @samp{.} syntax used by Daikon.
@end itemize

For an Input Output Automaton, @var{topLevel} consists of an Automaton name and
@var{bottomLevel} consists of information for a transition state.

By convention, the entry and exit points for a function have names of
a special form so that they can be associated with one another.
(Currently, those names end with @code{:::ENTER} and @code{:::EXIT}.)  This
convention permits Daikon to generate @nospellcheck{pre-state} variables
(@pxref{Variable names,,,daikon,Daikon User Manual}) automatically at
procedure exit points, so
front ends need not output them explicitly.  When there
are multiple exit points, then each one should be suffixed by a number
(such as a line number, for example, @code{foo::EXIT22}).  Daikon produces
the main (non-numbered) @code{:::EXIT} point automatically.  All the
numbered exits should contain the same set of variables; in general,
this means that local variables are not included at exit points.
Daikon requires that declarations for @code{:::ENTER} program
points appear before any declarations for matching @code{:::EXIT} program
points.

Another convention is to have another program point whose
@var{bottomLevel} is empty and whose @var{pptInfo} is  @code{OBJECT}:
for example, @code{StackAr:::OBJECT}.  This contains the
representation invariant (sometimes called the object invariant) of a
class.  This program point is created automatically by Daikon; it need
not appear in a trace file.

@c This program point is not created automatically by Daikon, because
@c there isn't a way to know whether a particular method is a private
@c helper method or not --- that is, whether the representation
@c invariants should hold on entry to and exit from it.



@node       V1 VarComparability declaration
@subsection V1 VarComparability declaration

There is a special @code{VarComparability} declaration that controls how
the comparability field in program point declarations is interpreted.
The default @code{VarComparability} is @code{implicit}, which means
ordinary comparability as described in @ref{Program point declarations}.
(The name @code{implicit} is retained for historical reasons.)
You can override it as
follows:
@example
VarComparability
none
@end example

@noindent
As with all records in Daikon input files, a
blank line is required between this record and the next one.

@node       V1 ListImplementors declaration
@subsection V1 ListImplementors declaration

This declaration indicates classes that implement the
@code{java.util.List} interface, and should be treated as sequences
for the purposes of invariant detection.  The syntax is as follows:

@example
ListImplementors
<classname1>
<classname2>
...
@end example

@noindent
Each @code{classname} is in Java format (for example, @file{java.util.LinkedList}).

The @option{--list_type} command-line option to Daikon can also be used to
specify classes that implement lists; @pxref{Options to control invariant
detection,,,daikon,Daikon User Manual}.
