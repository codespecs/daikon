The easiest way to build and run Daikon is to put either java/, or else
daikon.jar, on your classpath.

For external libraries in this directory, we supply both the original
distribution (for completeness) and also, if the original distribution is
not a .jar file, the .jar file (for use by Java).

bcel-util-all-0.0.4.jar : https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cbcel-util

commons-exec-1.3.jar : https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-exec/

java-getopt.jar : http://www.urbanophile.com/arenn/coding/download.html
- GNU getopt 1.0.8 command-line option parser
- Distributed with java files alongside class files in the jar file.
  The java files must be stripped from the jar, otherwise jikes tries
  to compile the java files inside the jar.
  1. Download java-getopt-1.0.8.jar
  2. "jar xf java-getopt-1.0.8.jar"
  3. "cd gnu"
  4. "rm `find . -name *.java`"
  5. "cd .."
  6. "jar cf java-getopt.jar gnu/"

junit-4.12.jar : https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Download-and-Install

options-all-0.3.1.jar : https://github.com/plume-lib/options
- using JDK 7, uncomment and run shadowJar task

require-javadoc-0.0.7.jar : https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/plumelib/require-javadoc/0.0.7/

daikon-util.jar : Just like plume-util-*.jar, but with package
changed to daikon.util.  To create, run:
java \
-cp $HOME/java/jarjar/jarjar-command/build/libs/jarjar-command-1.0.0.jar:${HOME}/java/jarjar/jarjar-core/build/libs/jarjar-core-1.0.0.jar:${HOME}/tmp/jopt-simple-5.0.4.jar:${HOME}/tmp/asm-6.0/lib/asm-commons-6.0.jar:${HOME}/tmp/asm-6.0/lib/asm-6.0.jar:${HOME}/tmp/slf4j-1.7.25/slf4j-simple-1.7.25.jar:${HOME}/tmp/slf4j-1.7.25/slf4j-api-1.7.25.jar \
com.tonicsystems.jarjar.Main \
--rules daikon-util-rules.txt plume-util-*.jar --output daikon-util.jar

Motivation for daikon-util.jar:
The daikon.util classes are used only by the run-time support for
instrumentation tools (that is, anything that might run in the same JVM as
a target program), namely Chicory and DynComp.  All other parts of Daikon
use plume-lib.
Suppose that both DynComp and the target program both used plume-lib.
If DynComp instrumented plume-lib, then an infinite recursion would
result; if DynComp did not instrument plume-lib, then DynComp would
miss some computations of the target program.  Thus, DynComp needs to
be completely separate from the target program -- they should share no
code.  To enable DynComp to work properly on a program that uses
plume-lib, DynComp must not use plume-lib.  Therefore, DynComp uses a
renamed version of plume-lib that is not used by any other program,
including Daikon itself.  DynComp can instrument the plume package,
but it does not instrument daikon.util.
