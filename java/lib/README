The easiest way to build and run Daikon is to put either java/, or else
daikon.jar, on your classpath.

For external libraries in this directory, we supply both the original
distribution (for completeness) and also, if the original distribution is
not a .jar file, the .jar file (for use by Java).

GNU getopt 1.0.8 (java-getopt.jar)
- Command line option parser
- Distributed with java files alongside class files in the jar file.
  The java files must be stripped from the jar, otherwise jikes tries
  to compile the java files inside the jar.
  1. Download java-getopt-1.0.8.jar
  2. "jar xf java-getopt-1.0.8.jar"
  3. "cd gnu"
  4. "rm `find . -name *.java`"
  5. "cd .."
  6. "jar cf java-getopt.jar gnu/"

JUnit 4.12 (junit-4.12.jar)
- Downloaded from: https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Download-and-Install

plume-lib (plume.jar)
- A library of useful abstractions for programming.
- https://github.com/mernst/plume-lib.git
- Note to Daikon developers: you manually have to update plume.jar
  with the correct build; this file is not automatically rebuilt from
  the plume-lib source in the Daikon root directory!
  plume.jar needs to be compiled with a JSR 308 compiler, so its annotations
  are present in the .jar file.  However, it has to be compiled with "-target
  7" or the like, so that it can be used by a Java 7 JVM.
- Note that plume-lib includes BCEL, Apache Commons IO, JUnit,
  and the Checker Framework qualifiers.
