 * Factory to create and describe derived variables. DerivationFactory creates a Derivation[] per

 * Derivation[] using instantiate(). DerivationFactory chooses how many (if any) Derivations to
 * instantiate (so calling classes don't have to decide).
 *
 * <p>This class contains no methods because UnaryDervationFactory and BinaryDerivationFactory have
 * instantiate() methods that take a different number of arguments.
