<p>
Data structures for handling suppression.  Here is how suppression
works:
</p>

<p>
An invariant is suppressed if it is implied by another invariant.  A
suppressed invariant is not checked as long as its suppressor is true.
This saves time for checking long data trace files.  Not outputting
suppressed invariants reduces output spam for obvious invariants.
</p>

<p>
In general, the non printing of invariants can be classified into
"static" and "dynamic" reasons.  A static reason is one that can be
determined without looking at the dtrace file.  Suppression is a
dynamic method.  Suppression is only for true invariants.  Suppression
is different from other non printing methods because it is based on
other invariants that can later become falsified.
</p>

<p>
Suppression is NOT:
</p>

<ul>

<li> The non-instantiation of invariants that are obvious in and of
themselves.  This is instead done by a combination of static methods
(e.g. A[i] is an element of A[]) and dynamic methods (LinearBinary
finds out that it reduces to A==B, which is obvious).
</li>

<li> The hiding of invariants during printing for various other
reasons.  For example, some invariants are not printed because their
VarInfos aren't interesting.  Suppression only works where one
invariant logically implies another.
</li>

<li> A mechanism for (efficiently) handling equality.
daikon.PptSliceEquality and daikon.inv.Equality do this.  However,
suppression is able to use Equality invariants for suppressing.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Invariants are suppressed by SuppressionLinks, each of which stores a
suppressed invariant and a list of suppressors (since a conjunction of
invariants may together suppress one other invariant).  The class that
generates SuppressionLink objects is a SuppressionFactory.  There are
many different kinds of SuppressionFactorys, one for each suppression
rule we have.  Most SuppressionFactorys are attached to the
invariant classes that they would suppress.
</p>

<p>
Suppression itself happens at the PptTopLevel.  Initially (or after
some small set of samples are fed) a PptTopLevel iterates through its
invariants and attempts to suppress them by its attemptSuppression()
method, which asks the invariant's associated SuppressionFactorys to
attempt suppression.  Each SuppressionFactory in turn generates
SuppressionTemplates, which are lists of Invariant types and VarInfos
that would be able to make a valid SuppressionLink.  The
SuppressionFactory asks the potential suppressee's PptTopLevel (the
same one as the one mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph) to
fillSuppressionTemplate().  If a template is successfully filled, then
the invariant is suppressed.  During filling, other PptTopLevels are
accessed to attempt to fill the template.
</p>

<p>
During dtrace file reading, when a sample is fed, suppression works
through PptTopLevel.add():
</p>

<ul>

<li> Make a set of PptSlices called "viewsToCheck" that have to be
given the sample.  Initially, the set is all the PptSlices.
</li>

<li> Check invariants in viewsToCheck by calling their add() method.
Attempt suppression on any invariants that fall/flow down and are
resurrected.  Also attempt suppression on any invariants in this ppt
that weaken.
</li>

<li> For any falsified or flowed invariants, take the invariants they
were suppressing, and attempt to re-suppress them by creating a new
SuppressionLink for them.  If an invariant is in the same PptTopLevel
as its former suppressor, add its PptSlice to the set of slices to
check.  A suppressed invariant could have been in a different slice
from its suppressor, but it is not necessary to check such invariants
because a) The slice can't be higher than this and b) If the slice is
lower, it will be checked later in the data flow.
</li>

<li> Repeat while there are slices to check.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
The only interface for suppressing an invariant is through the
attemptSuppression() method in PptTopLevel (i.e. don't try to suppress
an Invariant any other way).  The only interface for finding
invariants that are potential suppressors is through
PptTopLevel.fillSuppressionTemplate().  SuppressionFactorys should
not attempt to find invariants on their own, because
fillSuppressionTemplate respects the global option of whether a
suppressed invariant may suppress another invariant (and later,
invariant cycle detection).  However, SuppressionLinks may be
generated from different template searches (i.e. you don't have to
only generate SuppressionLinks from one template, just make sure all
the suppressors were found using fillSuppressionTemplate()).
</p>

<p>
How SuppressionFactorys are discovered by Daikon: every time an
Invariant is checked for whether it is suppressed, its
getSuppressionFactories() method is called.  Each Invariant subtype
implements getSuppressionFactories() to return the relevant
SuppressionFactorys.
</p>

<p>
Suppression obeys an "ordering" property or properties.  A suppressee
is never checked, so it cannot fall down the Ppt partial order while
suppressed.
</p>

<p>
Suppression also relies on the invariant uniqueness property.  That
is, for a given PptSlice, there exists exactly one instance of an
invariant subtype.  For example, if the SubSet invariant (which is
non-commutative) applies to (A, B) and to (B, A) then there is one
instance of SubSet of the PptSlice for A and B.  Note: different
invariant subtypes can still overlap: if A &lt; B, then there will be an
IntLessThan for (A, B) and an IntGreaterThan for (B, A) - however the
PptSlice may contain exactly one instance of IntLessThan.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, suppression relies on the fact that invariants at lower
ppts are stronger than invariants in their parents.  If this isn't
true, then the search in the ppt partial order for a potential
suppressor becomes intractable.  This and the "uniqueness" property
above are also necessary for the flow algorithm to be correct, since
an Invariant does not flow to a lower PptSlice if an instance of its
class already exists in the lower slice.
</p>

<p>
Note for Invariant cloning: SuppressionLinks are NEVER shared between
two Invariants, even if they are clones.  A clone always starts with
no suppressors or suppressees.
</p>

<p>
Suppression has two modes, set by Daikon.suppress_with_suppressed.
When the flag is on, suppressed invariants can suppress
others.  When off, only unsuppressed invariants can suppress.  The
latter is safer, but yields a lower suppression rate.  The former is
unsafe, because if there is a cyclic suppression pattern between
invariants, then all of them could be suppressed, giving very little
information to the user!  The ideal thing to do in the future is to
use proper cycle detection between invariant dependencies: the
invariants that remain from suppression must be able to logically get
the invariants that are suppressed, in some order.  Maybe this is a
way of saying "suppressors must have path cover".  Then again, if
all our SuppressionFactorys are statically proved to be acyclic,
then we don't need to worry.
</p>

<p>
Users can chose whether to use suppression during checking by using
the "--suppress" flag.  They can no longer choose whether to use
suppression during printing, because this is now handled by a filter
(i.e. let them use the GUI; it's on by default for printing).
