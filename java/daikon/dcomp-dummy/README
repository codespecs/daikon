This directory contains the initial, dummy version of java.lang.DCRuntime.

Post Java 8 there are increased security checks when loading JDK classes. In particular, the
core classes contained in the java.base module may not reference anything outside of
java.base. This means we cannot pre-instrument classes in the same manner as was done for
Java 8 as this would introduce external references to the DynComp runtime.

However, we can get around this restriction in the following manner: We to create a shadow
DynComp runtime called java.lang.DCRuntime that contains all the public methods of
daikon.dcomp.DCRuntime, but the method bodies contain only a return statement.  When we
pre-instrument java.base we do two things differently from the JDK 8 case: we change all
references to daikon.dcomp.DCRuntime to refer to java.lang.DCRuntime instead, and we add
our dummy java.lang.DCRuntime to our java.base replacement jar. This allows us to pass the
security test when a class from java.base is loaded. Then, during DynComp startup, this
dummy version is replaced with the version in dcomp-transfer where each method calls the
corresponding method in daikon.dcomp.DCRuntime.

The java source file in this directory is named DCRuntime.java.dummy and the resulting class
file is named DCRuntime.class.dummy.  This is to prevent the build system from being confused with
multiple versions of DCRuntime.

This file will only need to be modified if additional public methods that are to be used
in instrumented code are added to the real DCRuntime (daikon.dcomp.DCRuntime).  We do not
anticipate that happening; but if it does:

1) add the corresponding dummy methods to DCRuntime.java.dummy
2) copy DCRuntime.java.dummy to DCRuntime.java
3) make sure the version in ../dcomp-transfer has been renamed to something that does not end in '.java'
4) run 'make' which will rebuild the file (as well as doing other parts of the build)
5) rename DCRuntime.class to DCRuntime.class.dummy
6) delete DCRuntime.java
7) rename the file in ../dcomp-transfer
7) proceed to ../dcomp-transfer and follow the instructions in that README to complete the process.

Note that the file daikon/dcomp-dummy/DCRuntime.class.dummy is used later in the build process during
the construction of dcomp_rt.jar.
