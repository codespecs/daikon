 * string argument that describes the method that this routine replaces. This argument is in the
 * form type-name, where type is either static or instance and name is the fully qualified method
 * name. For example, "static-java.lang.Short.valueOf" or "instance-java.lang.StringBuffer.append"
 *
 * <p>The arguments of the annotated methods must match exactly the arguments of the method it
 * replaces. If the replaced method is an instance method, the first argument should be of the
 * receiver type.
