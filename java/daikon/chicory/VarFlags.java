/**
 * An enumeration of various flags that give information about variables. This enum is also present
 * in Daikon (in the <code>VarInfo</code> class), but is <i>intentionally</i> not shared in an
 * effort to keep Daikon and Chicory completely independent. If you make a change, then you need to
 * change it in all places.
 *
 * <p>These names are written into decl files; they should be the same across every Daikon front-end
 * (Java or otherwise), so please do not change a name without a very good reason. Adding new names
 * is fine.
 *
 * <p>These are documented in the Daikon Developer Manual, in section "A.3.3 Variable declarations"
 * (but really ought to be documented here too...).
