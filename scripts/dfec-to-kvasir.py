# The point of this script is to convert Dfec-generated .decls data
# with Lackwit comparability info. into a form that Kvasir can
# understand so that we don't have to run Dfec at all.

# Takes a .decls file that Dfec produced (with Lackwit comparability),
# a .decls file that Kvasir produced (with DynComp comparability), and
# outputs 4 .decls file that contain the intersection of Dfec and
# Kvasir program points and variables in a format that is compatible
# with Kvasir:
#
# kvasir-with-lackwit.decls: comparability numbers from Lackwit
# kvasir-with-dyncomp.decls: comparability numbers from DynComp
# kvasir-with-declared-types.decls: comparability numbers inferred from declared types
# kvasir-no-comp.decls: no comparability numbers (this is the same thing that
#                       --var-list-file=intersection.vars would generate)
#
# and outputs a variable list file (intersection.vars) so that Kvasir
# can be run and trace data can be collected only for those variables.

# Created on 2005-08-09 by Philip Guo

# Usage: (Takes in 7 filenames as params.  The first 2 files are inputs
#         and the latter 5 are outputs.)
# ./Lackwit2DynComp.py dfec-produced.decls kvasir-produced.decls kvasir-with-lackwit.decls kvasir-with-dyncomp.decls kvasir-with-declared-types.decls kvasir-no-comp.decls intersection.vars

# If everything goes correctly, kvasir-with-lackwit.decls and
# kvasir-with-dyncomp.decls should only differ in their comparability
# numbers.  Also, when running Kvasir with the
# --var-list-file=intersection.vars option, both of these .decls files
# should be compatible with the resulting .dtrace file so that Daikon
# can run on both sets of output.

# Dfec doesn't append the filename in front of
# file-static global variables like Kvasir does

# Dfec also doesn't print out function-static variables
# while Kvasir does

# Dfec derives two Daikon variables for strings
# one for the pointer and the other for the contents,
# while Kvasir only has one for the contents.

# Dfec uses the arrow notation for struct names while
# Kvasir uses the bracket notation (unless disambiguation

# Dfec and Kvasir program point name differences:

# Global program point names in Dfec are prefixed by 'std.'
# while they are prefixed by '..' in Kvasir

# Dfec uses 'EXIT1' while Kvasir uses 'EXIT0' for the exit
# so we should probably simply search for 'EXIT' without
# regard to the number behind it.  However, Dfec can have
# more than 1 exit while Kvasir can only have 1.  Hmmm,
# what do we do about that?
# (Right now, we just keep 'EXIT' without the number before
#  putting it in the hashtable.  Thus, only one EXIT ppt
#  is kept for each function ... I'm just not sure which
#  one, though, but that's ok)

# Dfec's names for C functions have crap in between the parens
# while Kvasir's doesn't.  Let's just not worry about what's
# in the parens since C doesn't have overloading.  We just want
# to strip off the canonical function name.

# Strips the extraneous stuff off of Dfec's names and returns
# a 2-tuple of ppt name and either 'ENTER' or 'EXITxxx'
