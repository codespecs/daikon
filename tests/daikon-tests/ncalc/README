This is a simple test of Daikon's ability to process a Java program that calls native code.

It is built using the Java Native Interface (JNI) that enables Java code running in a Java
Virtual Machine (JVM) to interact with native applications and libraries written in other
languages, such as C or C++.

libcalculator.so is a shared code library that contains a single function that returns the
result of adding its two interger arguments. This file is checked into the repository, but
if it should need to be recreated here are the steps.

First, compile the java code with the '-h' option:
  javac -h . ncalc.java
This creates the normal .class file but also a .h file that describes the JNI interface the
java program is calling.

Then to create the shared libary:
  gcc -fPIC -I"$JAVA_HOME/include" -I"$JAVA_HOME/include/linux" -shared -o libcalculator.so ncalc.c

In general, when running a Java program tha uses JNI, you need to tell the JVM where to findr
any shared library code. For example:
  java -Djava.library.path=. ncalc
However, the current directory (.) is one of the default locations the JVM searches. Makefile.common
has been modified to copy the library to where Chicory is run. This is not necessary for DynComp
as it is run here in this directoy.
