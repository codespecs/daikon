This is a simple test of Daikon's ability to process a Java program that calls native code.

It is built using the Java Native Interface (JNI) that enables Java code running in a Java
Virtual Machine (JVM) to interact with native applications and libraries written in other
languages, such as C or C++.

libcalculator.so is a shared code library that contains a single function that returns the
result of adding its two integer arguments. This file is checked into the repository, but
if it should need to be recreated here are the steps.

First, compile the java code with the '-h' option:
  javac -h . ncalc.java
This creates the normal .class file but also a .h file that describes the JNI interface the
java program is calling.

Then to create the shared library:
  gcc -fPIC -I"$JAVA_HOME/include" -I"$JAVA_HOME/include/linux" -shared -o libcalculator.so ncalc.c

In general, when running a Java program that uses JNI, you need to tell the JVM where to find
any shared library code. For example:
  java -Djava.library.path=. ncalc
For Daikon testing we do this by adding the line:
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(PROJECT) && \
in tests/Makefile.common. This is inserted prior to every use of DynComp or Chicory. Note
that this means it is set for every test case, but that should not be a problem as no other
test uses 'loadLibrary'.
