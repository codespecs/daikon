It does not seem possible, at this time, to get this test
to pass on all platforms.  It is written in C++ and uses
lots of the tricky bits.  The generated Dwarf code turns
out to be very compiler dependent.

In addition, the test case itself is timing dependent and
X11 enabled dependent. So either we need a unique set of
goal files for each compiler/system combination or we just
leave it turned off.  We have opted for the later.
