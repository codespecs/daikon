;  The general form of the options is "Variable=value".  Everything 
;  between the equals sign and the end of the line is considered part 
;  of the value.  The spacing and layout is free-form but only one option 
;  per line is allowed.  Variables and values are not case-sensitive.  
;
;  Note: characters after a semi-colon are treated as a comment
;
;  Traditional POV-Ray switches beginning with + or - are also allowed
;  and they may be given with more than one switch per line.  
;
;  Add your own options at the bottom and/or edit these to suit. See the
;  general documentation for full instructions on how to use INI options.

; Specify path to search for any files not found in current

; There may be some entries already here; if there are they were
; probably added by the install process or whoever set up the
; software for you. At the least you can expect an entry that
; points to the standard POV-Ray include files directory; on
; some operating systems there may also be one which points to
; the system's fonts directory.
;
; Note that some platforms (e.g. Windows, unless this feature is
; turned off via the configuration file) will automatically append
; standard locations like those mentioned above to the library
; path list after reading this file, so in those cases you don't
; necessarily have to have anything at all here.
