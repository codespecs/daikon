-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
OVERVIEW

This document contains a short overview of the Kvasir regression test suite.

The tests are split into two categories: small tests, and actual applications.

The small tests are very brief tests intended to test Kvasir's handling of some
language feature. Most of these tests are named after the feature they are testing.
Examples include: ArrayTest, IntTest, GlobalTest, etc.

The actual applications are a small set of actual C/C++ applications that we run
through Kvasir. We test the following applications.

A reference implementation of the rijndael encryption algorithm.
bzip2
bc
flex (A special single-file version, as well as a pristine copy)
gzip
md5
perl
wordplay

Of the test, we only produce .dtrace files for bc, md5, and wordplay as the other
programs would produce dtraces of a size that would be unfeasible for nightly
testing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES

UnionComp is a special test meant to illustrate a known dyncomp bug that is caused
by a limitation in Kvasir's handling of unions. More detail can be found in
the comments of UnionComp.c.

In addition to comparability issues, unions tend to produce a lot of garbage in the
dtrace output. This can cause problems when testing the regression of different versions
of the same binary (for example,such issues were encountered during the regression testing
while moving from GCC 3 to GCC 4). Generally this can be handled by simply converting
all unions to structs in the target program. 

dtrace-append is a test meant to check if Kvasir correctly outputs appended traces

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NON-WORKING TESTS

These tests are meant to illustrate some features that Kvasir does not currently support,
mainly due to its handling of function entry/exit.

pthread-test - used to gauge the ability of Fjalar to handle multithreaded situations. 
This is a simple test which forces an interleaving of 2 functions.

ExceptionTest -  a simple test of C++ Exception handling

setjmp-test - Test of setjmp/longjump

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO

- Test more command line arguments. These occasionally pop up and tend to be
very irritating to the user

- The test suite currently creates an entire set of goal files for every compiler 
version with differences. Currently this is not a problem, but if the amount of
different goal file sets we need to maintain becomes large, it may be more prudent
to keep one canonical goal file set and maintain the rest as diffs (or possibly utilize
some other scheme)

DYNCOMP ARCHITECTURAL ISSUES

The following tests have known comparability issues due to handling of comparability
with regards to registers. Please see 
$INV/valgrind-3/valgrind/fjalar/notes/dyncomp-architectural-issues.txt  for more info.

PointerTest - Fields of a struct merged due to the entire struct being put into a single
              register.
TrivialTest - Same as above, plus use of memset.
TypedefTest - Same as above, however struct was 13 bytes (meaning it was split across 2 registers,
              and all fields which shared a register were combined)
