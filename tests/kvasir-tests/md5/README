To temporarily eliminate a goal file difference, I haved committed an
'incorrect' md5.dtrace.goal-Ubuntu.
markro 2/17/2026

md5.dtrace.goal fails (Ubuntu only) due to the compiler generating 
stack probes. These are produced when you allocate large amounts on the
stack (typically >4KB) because the OS needs to know you're actually
using those pages. The probe touches each page so the OS can:
  allocate physical memory
  detect stack overflows
  properly set up guard pages
Without the probe, you could blow past your stack limit without the OS
noticing until you actually access the memory - then crash mysteriously.

These probes break our heuristic for determining where the function's
prologue ends. I think I know how to fix this, but it will require a
significant amount of work in Kvasir.
