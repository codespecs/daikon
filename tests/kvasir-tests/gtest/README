This test case comes from the Google C++ Testing Framework.
It is a sample program provided with the release.
The version used was gtest-1.6.0.

It will always fail the dtrace compare due to program variables
containing elapsed time. So we ignore the dtrace file diff.

Similarly, the invs output contains timing values and some of the
invariants are dependent on the current directory.
Hence, we ignore the invs file diff.

Finally, the counts file has a few lines that also are dependent
on the current directory.  We run a small script to remove these
lines prior to the diff.
